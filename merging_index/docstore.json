Over the last few years, several attempts have been made for structured learning events in health insurance. Industry chambers like FICCI and CII have \nheld annual workshops around this theme, it features prominently in the \ncurriculum of management schools, especially those involved in insurance courses; another prominent early effort in this direction was a one-week course developed by the Ministry of Health, WHO India and the Institute of Public Health which has been offered about once a year since 2006. I have been associated with all of the above learning streams for several years, and have increasingly realized that health insurance is a fairly complex discipline and yet at its infancy in India, and that there is tremendous need for formal learning \nprogrammes in Health Insurance customized to the country\u2019s context and \nrequirements. \nI n  t h i s  b a c k d r o p ,  i t  w a s  i n d e e d  m y  g o o d  f o r t u n e  t o  h a v e  b e e n  a b l e  t o  c o -\nordinate and edit this course material for the Associateship examination of the Insurance Institute of India. The formal qualifications offered by the Insurance Institute of India have been enthusiastically pursued by thousands of students every year, and I hope that a similar enthusiasm awaits the new health \ninsurance specialization which this material endeavours to pioneer. \nI am humbled by the trust reposed in me by the Insurance Institute of India, and \nam particularly thankful to Mr Sharad Shrivastava and Mr B S Rathaur in the institute for their unfailing support in developing this course material. My former colleagues in IRDA, Ms Yegna Priya Bharath, who was closely involved in conceptualizing this course, and Ms J Meena Kumari, who reviewed the data and pricing sections of this work, have been pillars of strength. I drew heavily from \nour experience and association in developing a training manual and in \nconducting a series of face-to-face health insurance courses for managers of health insurance schemes in government and non-profit organizations, and I must thank Dr N Devadasan and Dr Sunil Nandraj who pioneered the concept and believed in it.  \nThis publication could not have been in your hands if it had not been for the \ndedicated efforts of the contributors, briefly listed on the next page. They are \nall busy professionals, and have been able to devote time amidst their already \nvery hectic schedules, driven entirely by their passion and commitment for this subject. Indeed, I have often required them to take time off their vacations and weekends to be able to meet our ambitious timelines and they have always been supportive and understanding and have delivered excellent learning material, and on time.  \n\nLast, but certainly not the least, I must thank Garima and Meyher, for being so \nconsiderate with me as I worked through weekends and late nights in making my small contribution to this very noble cause- much of the time I devoted was legitimately theirs. Belonging to a family which has been genetically passionate \nabout insurance for three generations now, I hope they would understand.  \n-Dr. Somil Nagpal \n\nABOUT THE EDITOR \nDr.Somil Nagpal  is a well recognised face in the health insurance industry in \nIndia.

Meaning of health insurance \n1. Health insurance \nAs we all are aware that future is unpredictable and rather, uncertain. \nAny person can meet with illness, bodily injury or any accident due to some \nunfortunate or unexpected event at any point of time. A lot of expenses are incurred due to such events like hospital stay, medicines, surgery, doctor\u2019s visit and other medical expenses. \nHealth Insurance provides coverage towards all or few of such healthcare needs \nand medical expenses incurred by a person. \nDefinition \nHealth Insurance is a way to distribute the financial risk associated with the variation of individual\u2019s health care expenditures by pooling costs over time (pre-payment) and over people (pooling). \n(OECD 2004) \nThis definition explains how the health insur ance system works. The health \ninsurance  insures an individual from expenses incurred due to any variation in \ntheir health. It collects an upfront contribution from an individual (commonly known as premium in the market) and pools it over many people. Thus it works very similar to all the other types of insurance in the market, the only difference being that it primarily covers health expenses of an individual. \n2. Commercial health insurance \nThe health insurance which is offered by insurance companies is commonly \nknown as Private Health Insurance or Commercial Health Insurance. Commercial \nhealth insurance term is used to avoid confusion between public insurance companies which are owned by the government and the private insurance companies. Therefore, it will be used interchangeably throughout this study text.\nCommercial health insurance basically provides coverage to an individual \ntowards all or some of the health services defined under a contractual \nagreement, health insurance policy  made between both of them. For this risk \ncoverage, the individual, i.e. insured will have to make the payments in the form of a premium to the insurer. The insurer, a non-governmental entity, will i n  t u r n  t a k e  u p  a l l  o r  m o s t  o f  t h e  r i s k  a s s o c i a t e d  f o r  p a y i n g  a l l  s u c h  h e a l t h  services which are defined under the policy. \n\nMEANING OF HEALTH INSURANCE  CHAPTER 1 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  33. Third party in health insurance \nHealth Insurance is different from all other insurances such as fire insurance, \ntheft insurance, home insurance etc. In all other insurances, there are mainly \ntwo parties:  \na) One is  insurer  who provides the insurance, usually an    insurance \ncompany, and  \nb) Other is insured , who is covered for likely risk to his/her life, property \nor health. \nHowever, in case of health insurance, there is one more party, the healthcare \nprovider  in the absence of which it loses its meaning. It plays a major role in \nthe health insurance as it is the one who decides and provides: \na) The type of health services to be used by an individual i.e. insured. \nb) How much of such services are used \nc) How much is the cost of those services \nThe involvement of this third party makes this insurance different and complex \ntoo. \nExample \nRavi met with an accident while going to his office and had serious injuries. He was hospitalised for five days in Gandhi Hospital. \nHe had taken a health insurance policy earlier. So, when he received the heavy \nmedical bills from his hospital at the time of discharge, he was not worried at \nall. When he submitted his claim to his insurer, they told him that it will take some time for them to get all the details from his healthcare provider before processing his claim.  \nThe healthcare provider, i.e. Gandhi Hospital in this case is the third party \nother than Ravi (insured) and the insurance company (insurer). Gandhi Hospital will provide all the details to the insurance company about the services used by \nRavi and the cost of those services which will become a basis for the insurer to \nclear the claim filed by Ravi. \n\nCHAPTER 1  MEANING OF HEALTH INSURANCE \n4 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE 4. Health insurance market \nEconomists describe health insurance as an \u2018imperfect market\u2019 because normal \nmarket forces do not work as expected in this case. \nThe imperfections in this market are mainly due to the following reasons: \na) Information asymmetry \nThe information available to both insurer and insured about each other is \neither incomplete or not completely transparent. \nThe insureds mostly do not understand the exact interpretation, meaning \nand coverage of their contact.  Many a times, they are also unaware of their \ninsurer\u2019s capabilities of covering the risk.  \nSimilarly, insurer is also sometimes not fully aware about the likely risk to a \nperson\u2019s health. So, they may also end up in pricing the risk incorrectly. \nb) Risk selection \nFor a health insurance, both the insurer and insured will try to make the risk \nselection on the basis of decision cost-effective to each of them.  \nThe insurer will obviously select and insure the proposer with a low risk as \ncompared to the one with a high risk. This is also termed as \u2018cherry-picking\u2019 or \u2018cream-skimming\u2019. \nSimilarly, the person with a higher health risk would want to purchase \nhealth insurance more than a healthy person with low risk.  \nThe insurer decides on the basis of acceptance and pricing rules, which risks \nthey will accept and at what price, through a process known as underwriting. Underwriting is explained in detail later in Chapter 4. \nExample \nA person within age group of 20-40 years is less prone to normal health risks as \ncompared to a person aged above 50 years. Therefore, a senior person will be more interested in taking a health insurance to meet his medical expenses as compared to a young aged person who will be more relaxed towards his health. \nThis is also known as \u2018adverse selection\u2019. \nOn the contrary, an insurance company will be more interested in providing a \nhealth insurance to a young aged person rather than a senior person.", "start_char_idx": 9250, "end_char_idx": 18482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f45b7e20-1aee-41c0-b4a6-defd63fbed53": {"__data__": {"id_": "f45b7e20-1aee-41c0-b4a6-defd63fbed53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "826a47a5-c1d0-4d41-aea8-063a10869b73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cd1f4603674c31d0ad746d1f62e945366488b720e22165f9337e55dd2f50af1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c3a7e83-1b36-409f-baf3-e9e9655a5de0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "023bb8c4b92e4a606e3afbaa52556b5e6b90c315c06a5ea58eec1f58c06abe8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "cc82c2ad-f572-4e3e-b732-dde93c3f49cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2bd7d21b3277423e13c9b710b84f0b94c657319871e0c0d407ba9e1f4a1e9f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "c41f0ee1-6773-48d2-976d-6ff3275df8c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50b4ea8269e69ee38bb5d4b4d8d60f63f9ad1b3c292190ddacac05e0546778a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "2ee76fbd-9393-4fa1-ba99-9e695a51849c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8661b4bc5e3a3be1e73e741a38eef6b51a77cc57016ce68077498086df3e647", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "47245278-c205-46ab-a1eb-b999acbfd7f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4bbe21b9de32a034ddfac579e1b52d1fb43eb450e43e80ee422482519ea41344", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "ecd505bc-ed26-4007-8d7d-c6a01edd47e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "69078dc079b89269611c0e632f010d2018a36435815e6701ce8042b8f6f068e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Even if it will provide health insurance to senior person, the premium will be quite high. This is because   insurance company is also aware that young people are usually less prone towards any health risks as compared to senior people. So, it is less \nrisky and more profitable for an insurance company to provide insurance to the \nyoung people. \n\nMEANING OF HEALTH INSURANCE  CHAPTER 1 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  5c) Moral hazard \nMoral Hazard is mainly related to the insured and sometimes also to the \nhealthcare providers. There are mainly two types of moral hazards: \ni. Demand side moral hazard: It works at insured\u2019s end. A consumer with a \nhealth insurance will make use of and accept more health services than he would have otherwise taken without any health insurance. \nii. Supply side moral hazard: It works at the end of Health providers. They \nstart suggesting and providing more health services as well to more expensive treatment to the person having health insurance.  \nVarious cost containment mechanisms are use by the health insurers to \nminimise these moral hazards which will be discussed in the later chapters. \nExample \nMahesh, aged 28 years had taken a health insurance from a private insurance \ncompany that provides for reimbursement of the expenses incurred on health. \nHe is normally a very healthy person. \nOne day he had some food in a party which resulted in stomach disorder for \nhim. Usually in such cases, he will take some medicines at home and will take some routine care to recover. But as he was having an insurance policy this time, he thought of using it by going to an expensive hospital for check-up. \nHe went there and the doctor there suggested him to undergo some expensive \ntests and hospitalise him for a couple of days for full recovery. Taking into consideration his insurance policy coverage, he opted for the best room to stay in the hospital. He ended up with a heavy amount of bill in the hospital which his insurance company had to reimburse. \nHence, this example clearly indicates that an insurance coverage had made \nMahesh behave differently, with less consideration towards his medical bills which he otherwise would have not incurred if he did not have any insurance coverage to pay for his bills. \nAt the demand side, Mahesh incurred more expenses towards health services \nthan required. Similarly at the supply side, doctor also recommended more tests \nand expensive treatment than required due to health insurance coverage of his \npatient.\nTest Yourself 1\nHealth insurance provides coverage for which of the below? \nI.

Health insurance \u2013 a cover towards unpredictable illnesses \nThe out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by people in India on their health is \nvery high as compared to the other countries. It accounts for about 71% of all health expenditure in the country\n1,2\nDue to this, individuals have now started taking lead in planning for their own health expenditure especially when they can get it at an affordable cost. \nDue to unpredictable major illnesses, an individual may have to incur \nsubstantial amount of money from his savings at a short notice. According to an \nestimate, every year around 2.2% of India\u2019s population\n3,4 is leading towards \npoverty due to such illnesses. An illness may cause a potential impact on the finances of individuals and their families resulting in a catastrophic risk. \nHence, people realise that the planning for their health needs and taking an \nappropriate step to cover that risk is required. This resulted in millions of people opting for health insurance policy to  cover against such health risks.  \n2. Health insurance products in India \nHealth insurance products available in the Indian market are primarily \ndominated by hospitalisation products , which mean that these cover the high \nexpenses incurred by an individual during hospitalisation. These expenses are relatively high due to increasing cost of healthcare, surgical procedures, new and more expensive technology coming in the market and cost of newer \ngeneration of pharmaceuticals. With these increasing costs, it is really becoming \nvery difficult for an individual even if he is financially sound to bear such high expenses without any health insurance.   \nTherefore, a health insurance is important mainly for two reasons: \n/g57Providing financial access to healthcare providers  i n  c a s e  o f  a n y  \nillness.\n/g57Preservation of savings of an individual  which may otherwise be wiped \nout due to illness. \n                                             \n1 Mahal A, Sakthivel S, Nagpal S.

The cashless system \nThe cashless system of providing hospitalisation cover has immense value in \nterms of personal finances. It avoids the need to arrange a large amount of \nmoney by an individual for payment to the hospital, even if they were to be \nreimbursed or indemnified later by the insurer. Thus, the cashless hospitalisation cover minimises the need to keep surplus liquidity by an individual to meet any health eventualities. \nThe health insurance portfolio is now becoming the fastest growing market \nsegment  for the non-life insurance industry due to:  \n/g57Increasing awareness among the people about the protective role of \nhealth insurance, and  \n/g57Improved focus on marketing of health insurance products by the \ninsurers.  \nStill there is a tremendous potential for this market as even today, only about \n5% of the country\u2019s population has been covered by a commercial health \ninsurance product (excluding mass government schemes). \nTest Yourself 2\nWhich is the most dominated health insurance product in the Indian market? \nI.

Early development of the Indian insurance industry \nThe earliest mention of the insurance system in India can be found in the \nresearch and writings of treatise such as Manu (Manusmrithi), Yagnavalkya \n(Dharmasastra) and Kautilya (Arthasastra). They refer about the pooling of resources that could be re-distributed during the period of calamities such as fire, floods, epidemics and famine.  \nHowever, insurance in its modern form first arrived in India during the early 19\nth\ncentury. Both life and non-life insurance companies came to establish in India \nduring this period. \nThe Indian Life Assurance Companies Act, 1912 was the first act introduced to \nregulate the insurance companies in India. Later on in 1938, a new insurance act was passed to bring both life and non-life insurance companies under a single Act. This act has been revised from time to time, but does remain at the core of insurance laws for the country\n5.\nThe regulatory structure, as well as the constituents of the industry, underwent \nseveral changes over the next 7 decades, characterized particularly by the following sets of events which shaped the course of the Indian insurance \nindustry: \na) Nationalisation of life insurance industry in 1956 to merge number of \nprivate insurers into one Life Insurance Corporation  (LIC). \nNationalisation of non-life industry similarly in 1973 to merge number of \nprivate non-life insurers into one General Insurance Corporation  (with \nfour subsidiary companies), all owned by the Government of India. \nb) Establishment of the Insurance Regulator  based on a report by Malhotra \nCommittee in 1994 on \u2018Reforms in the Insurance Sector\u2019. Earlier interim \nregulator was established in 1996 which was later formed as a statutory \nauthority in 2000.  This resulted in a new reform in the insurance industry.  \nc) Opening up of the market finally for a new generation of private insurers \nfrom August 2000. \n                                             \n5 IRDA.

Thus, the States are largely independent in \nmatters related to the delivery of health care to the people in their area. Each state has developed its own system of health care delivery and created the necessary infrastructure. At the same time, some items having wider consequences like population control and family welfare, medical education, prevention of food adulteration, quality control in manufacture of drugs etc. have been included in the Concurrent list, where both centre and the states can issue legislation. In addition, the Centre also supports key health sector \ninitiatives through National Health Programme s, particularly the National Rural \nHealth Mission, which are funded by the Centre and generally implemented through the State machinery. \n2.

It is, however, to be remembered \nthat the prices paid by Government for bulk procurement of drugs is also much \nlesser than the prices of the same drugs in the retail market. \nWith the emerging changes in the patents regime, there is a risk for upward \nrevision of prices, especially for newer drugs. However as of now, the cost of drugs is still a smaller component of the inpatient bill due to which the commercial insurers in India have still not focused their attention on controlling costs of their pharmaceutical component. \nTest Yourself 6\nThe most peripheral public health institution available to the rural health population is _____________. \nI.

However, the Insurance Act 1938 remains as the  backbone for all the insurance laws in the country. \ng) Health insurance in India began with the Employees\u2019 State Insurance Scheme \nin 1948 for blue-collar workers employed in the formal private sector and \nwas followed by the Central Government Health Scheme in 1954 for the \ncentral government employees working for civilian assignments. \nh) The first standardised health insurance product, Mediclaim for individuals \nand their families was launched in 1986 in the Indian market. \ni) As per the constitution of India, the states are largely independent in \nmatters related to the delivery of health care to the people in their area; therefore each state has developed its own system of health care delivery and created the necessary infrastructure. \nj) The public health sector in rural areas is operated primarily through Sub-\ncentres, Primary Health Centres and Community Health Centres. \nk) India has a very large and heterogeneous private health sector and it \naccounts for more than 75% of all health spending in India.  \n\n  CHAPTER 1  PRACTICE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  18Answers to Test Yourself\nAnswer 1\nThe correct option is II.\nHealth insurance provides coverage for medical expenses. \nAnswer 2\nThe correct option is I.\nHealth insurance products available in the Indian market are primarily \ndominated by hospitalisation products.\nAnswer 3\nThe correct option is II.\nIndian Insurance Act, 1938 was passed to bring both life and non-life insurance \ncompanies under a single Act. \nAnswer 4\nThe correct option is I.\nThe Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) was introduced in 1954 for all \nthe central government employees working in civilian assignments and their families.\nAnswer 5\nThe correct option is III.\nThe Directorate General of Health Services is the principal advisory body the \nUnion Government in both medical and public health matters. \nAnswer 6\nThe correct option is II.\nSub-centre (SC) is the most peripheral public health institution available to the \nrural population.", "start_char_idx": 37245, "end_char_idx": 46375, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d6f0237-19b4-4bbe-a95b-cd36d84247c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d6f0237-19b4-4bbe-a95b-cd36d84247c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc48c6ea-9194-4f18-970e-a71fad31783f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c30801707813780dcc3e42ba5b769afeca85885b9d66161d8e3be60e6d273abf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c15afae2-72ed-4f43-85e9-04461d5f53f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58126b7f1fbe146c9638329221a1474775dcf7afe86c2f3cebc45bf215267be0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "14b964ef-c4f0-40c4-b24a-56160c1b18b8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3cc5c7d462570bfd27a09d48954cb890e030ae313c3db9b0055e340fc69cf862", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "dbd98ea7-909f-4cc8-b1c1-680aeb4adc1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afad692fb1d308f211810ca8e1ea6cbfe6005b52bab4eff7eed95380e8fb477d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "3d48c414-f30d-4673-9987-7195b4bcd977", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5050fcc794963fad1cf2a7c963e6796fbeb3d2df3457160a7b3565f06ca2b42b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "f4ded608-4736-4de6-bd09-0780de0d8745", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f46f3adae6d74e38554a355daeacff0fc842375f509b735f92eaddb54a92c136", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "2b71b99d-db75-4ab9-bb69-aff3eeb95de3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "638933d925268a3581f51ca7fd7076248a216c6cbf195ca66e1e10152e88d61f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "PRACTICE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  CHAPTER 1 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  19Self-Examination Questions\nQuestion 1\nEconomists describe health insurance as ______________market. \nI.

It will also discuss the health financing models of some of the countries, which will help to understand the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of each method of healthcare financing. Lastly, this chapter explains the health financing model of our \ncountry and its drawbacks in terms of access and quality. \nLearning Outcomes \nA. Sources of funds for healthcare needs \nB. Health financing models in various countries \nC. Health financing system in India and its problems \n\nCHAPTER 2  SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR HEALTHCARE NEEDS \n22 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Look at this scenario \nThere has been a rapid growth in the economic development of India in the past \nfew decades. But at the same time, social development particularly the development of the health sector has not been paid the required attention for with the same pace. A very less proportion of resources are allocated for the health sector.  \nAccording to some studies commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Family \nWelfare, the magnitude of health expenditure in India for the year 2008-09 was \nabout 4.13% of the GDP at current market prices.\n16, 17  \nHowever, in actual less than 1% of GDP is spent on the public health sector in \nIndia.\nA. Sources of funds for healthcare needs \nGlobally, the financing of the healthcare costs in any country is done through the following four methods: \n1. Government revenues and taxes  \nIn this system, the population contributes to the Government revenues \nindirectly via taxes, a share of which is then allocated by the Government for providing healthcare care services to the people. This is therefore also known as \ntax-funded system. Thus, the payment to the healthcare providers is made by \nthe Government on behalf of the users. \nExample \nIn UK, all residents are enrolled under National Health Services (NHS) which is primarily funded through the taxes paid to the Government.  It guarantees basic medical services to all residents of the UK by providing free medical treatment. Hence, it works on principle of equal treatment and provides equal access to all \nmedical services regardless of the financial status of an individual.  \n                                             \n16 National Health Accounts Cell, Minist ry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India.

New Delhi, 2005. \n\nSOURCES OF FUNDS FOR HEALTHCARE NEEDS  CHAPTER 2 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  232. Social health insurance\nIt is also referred to as an employment based health insurance. The employees \nand the employers pay a regular contribution to the funds that are then used for \nfunding healthcare needs for the employees as well as their families. Additional \nState support is also available in some of the cases. Moreover, the contribution to such schemes can be in varied forms ranging from a mandatory, earmarked, payroll-tax to a voluntary, tax-deductible contribution to a health plan.  \nExample \nESI Corporation set up in India for blue-collar employees is a good example of public health insurance. It is financed through a regular contribution from both the employees and the employers and is also supplemented by the Government. It provides comprehensive medical care to industrial sector employees and their \nfamilies.\n3. Commercial health insurance\nCommercial health insurance is also known as private health insurance is a \nhealth insurance taken by an individual, to provide coverage towards expenses \nincurred on their healthcare needs.  \nExample \nIn India, currently more than 300 health insurance products are available in the market for various healthcare needs.  For example, for a normally healthy person, basic health insurance policy is available from many insurance c o m p a n i e s .  S i m i l a r l y ,  f o r  s e n i o r  c i t i z e n s  a l s o  s o m e  s p e c i f i c  p r o d u c t s  a r e  available from few insurance companies. Many other plans are also there in the \nmarket to cover critical illnesses.  \nNowadays, most of these provide cashless facilities that minimises the need to \nmaintain any surplus fund by any individual to meet health casualties.   \n4. Out-of-pocket payments\nIt is a direct payment made by the households to the provider for their \nhealthcare needs without any coverage or reimbursements. \nThe global picture of health spending for the year 2007, as per WHO (2010), is \nsummarised below: \n\nCHAPTER 2  SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR HEALTHCARE NEEDS \n24 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Diagram 1: Composition of world health expenditures   \nSource:  National Health Accounts, WHO (2010) \nThus, health is a large industry globally, and commands US 5.3 trillion dollars \n(about Rs 240 lakh crores) of the world\u2019s resources, and the proportion of each sector is as follows: \nTable 2.1\nSource of Funds Composition (%) \nGovernment tax revenues 35\nSocial insurance 25\nPrivate insurance 18\nDirect payment by patients 18\nOther smaller sources 4\nThe percentage mentioned above clearly indicates that the share of \nGovernment tax revenues is highest among all these spending in the world. However, this 35% share does not include: \n/g57Any contribution made by the Government to the social health \ninsurance, and  \n/g57The indirect tax subsidies, often given by the Government to the private \nhealth insurance. \nSimilarly, households had to directly pay from their pocket 18% of the health \ncosts globally, but this percentage excludes: \n/g57Their contribution as taxes which is spent by the government on the \nhealthcare, or  \n/g57Their payments for insurance premiums that are pooled and spent on \ninsurance mechanisms. \n\nHEALTH FINANCING MODELS IN VA RIOUS COUNTRIES  CHAPTER 2 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  25Test Yourself 1\nWhich of the following sector has the highest contribution in financing of the \nhealthcare costs globally? \nI.

Germany \nGermany has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. In Germany, over \n90 percent of the residents receive healthcare through the statutory health insurance. It functions through non-profit sickness funds that collect premiums from members and pay health care providers according to pre-negotiated agreements.\nEmployers and employees contribute equally in the premiums, which in the first \nhalf of the 1990s averaged between 12 and 13 percent of a worker's gross \nearnings up to the income ceiling\n19. Hence, in simple terms, health insurance \npremium is collected from employees as a payroll tax. As this is a social health insurance scheme, premiums are set according to the earnings rather than the risk. The premiums are not affected by a member's marital status, family size or health. The unemployed continue to be members of their sickness fund, and their contributions are paid by federal and local Government offices. The contributions of retired workers are paid by themselves from their pension \nfunds.\nExample \nThe health financing model of Germany is a perfect example of a public health \ninsurance financing model which redistributes from higher to lower income groups, from the healthy to the sick, from the young to the old, from the employed to the unemployed, and from those without children to those with children. Employees who have private insurance also receive the benefit of part \nof their premiums being paid by their employers. \n                                             \n18Adapted from Devadasan N, Nagpal S.

France\nFrance has a system of employment-based public health insurance that now \ncovers everybody in the nation, though earlier, certain portions of the \npopulation lacked any health insurance.  \nThere are three healthcare funds operating in the country that are: \na) Main one covering most of the workers  \nb) One for the self-employed and c) One for the agricultural workers  \nThe financing of the system is through employer and employee contributions in \naddition to general taxes, of which the latter have been increasing in proportion in recent years. The funds are under the joint control of employers and employee unions, which are in turn supervised by the state. The contribution to \nthese funds is mandatory, and no one may opt-out of the scheme. Moreover, they are not allowed to compete with each other nor micromanage care.  \nThis insurance system covers a large share of all the health costs in the country, \nthe rest being met through out-of-pocket payments and the supplementary insurance covers. However, many of the French citizens also opt for some form of add-on private insurance, which pays for the various procedures and equipment that are not covered wholly by the public insurance\n20.\n3. United States of America \nSince World War II, employment-based health benefits have been the \nfoundation of health insurance in the United States for the under-65 population, providing the primary source of coverage for the vast majority of workers and their dependents. In 2004, 159.1 million individuals, or 62 percent of the non-elderly adult population were covered by the employment-based health benefits system.\nHowever, in recent years, the numbers of persons covered under employer-\nsponsored health insurance have been reducing sharply, mainly due to rising \ncost of providing healthcare benefits as comp ared to individual earnings. This \nhas resulted in a larger proportion of the US population without any health insurance coverage and forecasts of continuing declines in coverage. The overall impact on the economy is also not good due to increase in poorer health and death of uninsured individuals. \nThe Government provides insurance for the elderly (Medicare) and for the poor \n(Medicaid) which has been an increasing expenditure for the public exchequer. Overall, health costs account for an overwhelming 16% of the country\u2019s GDP and there are growing concerns over the sustainability of this expenditure. \n                                             \n20 Klein E.

Japan \nJapan achieved universal health coverage in 1961, through the National Health \nInsurance Act. The healthcare system in Japan has been considered as one of \nthe best in the world in terms of its accessibility and efficiency. This system \nprovides coverage to the entire population with a universal access to all medical services. The coverage is provided to each individual under any one of the following categories:  \na) Society-managed health insurance (SHI)\nThis program covers employees of large company (with more than 700 \nemployees) and their dependants.  These employers are required to \ncreate and operate their own health insurance plans within the Government regulations. It covers 26% of the Japan\u2019s population. \nb) Government managed health insurance (GHI)\nIn this scheme, the employees who are working with small employers \n(with less than 700 employees) and their dependants are automatically \nenrolled under a Government operated program known as \u2018small business \nnational health plan\u2019. This plan covers about 30% of Japan\u2019s population and is financed by both, the payroll taxes and the general fund revenue. \nc) National Health Insurance (NHI)\nIt covers self-employed, retired, unemployed and other people who are \nnot covered in above two plans. This plan is administered by the \nMunicipal Governments and is financed through compulsory premium on \nthe self-employed and general tax revenues. \nd) Long life medical care system\nThis plan was introduced in 1983 for the elderly person aged 75 and \nover. It also covers people aged 65 to 74 with certain certified disabilities. It is financed through a fixed nominal amount paid by the \ninsured (10%), contributions from the other plans (40%) and general tax \nrevenues (50%). \nAll these plans are required to cover a range of benefits, which include dental \ncare, maternity care, and prescription drugs. In 2008, over 80% of the health costs in Japan were borne by the Government and less than 20% came from private sources (just the opposite of the situation in India). \n\nCHAPTER 2  HEALTH FINANCING MO DELS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES \n28 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Example \nEnrolment in the health insurance system is compulsory in Japan and applies to \nall residents including foreigners (short-period visitors are excluded). Thus, a person who is not a resident of Japan but  have the permission to stay in Japan \nfor at least a year due to his studies or work is also required to join any one of \nthe insurance programs even if he is covered overseas under a private insurance. \nJapan\u2019s health financing system is designed in such a way that it ensures that \nevery resident is covered under any one of the insurance programs available in \nthe country.\n5. Chile\nThe functioning of the healthcare system in Chile21 has undergone major \nreforms in the early 1980s.  \nThe main features of this system are as follows: \na) The establishment of the National Health Fund (Fonasa) to administer \nthe social health insurance scheme. \nb) The establishment of Health Insurance Institutions, Isapres for the \nprivate sector players. \nc) The mandatory contribution by each employee and pensioner, equivalent \nto 7% of their wages towards healthcare system. \nThe population in Chile can opt to contribute into either of the two healthcare \nsystem, i.e. Fonasa (public health insurance system) or Isapres (private health \ninsurance system). About 67% of the population in Chile is enrolled with Fonasa, while 20% are covered under some 40,000 private plans with 18 licensed Isapres. Thus, the healthcare system in Chile is working on dual structure, both public and private sector working for healthcare services but on different principles.   \nBoth schemes are regulated by the Superintendence of Isapres, under the \nMinistry of Health (Government of Chile). Fonasa is funded to the tune of 50 per \ncent by general tax revenues of the government, while the remaining financing \noccurs through the mandatory contribution by employees and retired people. Substantial out-of-pocket payments are, however, common, despite the high wage contribution by the employees.  \n                                             \n21 Rao KS. Health Insurance in India.

Health financing system in India and its problems \nIn the last learning outcome, we discussed about the health financing system in various countries. We will now discuss about the health financing system in our country.\n1. Health financing system in India \nThe sources of health financing in India are almost same as indicated in the \nglobal picture above. The tax-based public health system has already been discussed in the previous chapter. We have also discussed about the various forms of employment-based health coverage that already exist in India, which \ninclude: \na) The widely recognized Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIS) for \nemployees in the formal sector,  \nb) The Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) for serving and retired civil \nservants,\nc) The schemes for serving and retired employees of the Armed Forces, \nRailways, Paramilitary forces and other Government organizations, and \nd) The various health coverage schemes and benefits provided by banks, \ninsurers, other public sector companies and the private sector employers\n26.\n2. Public expenditure on health in India  Out of the total health expenditure in the country, the share of public or \nGovernment spending, i.e. that of Central, State and Local Governments taken \ntogether, is about one-fifth of the total health expenditure (NHA Cell, 2009).  \nAs a result of this, Indian population is mostly dependent upon the privatised \nhealthcare system. In India, the private healthcare expenditure amounts to around 72% and the public expenditure is around 26% of the total healthcare expenditure.   \n                                             \n26 M a h a l  A ,  S a k t h i v e l  S ,  N a g p a l  S .

At about 1% of the GDP, India\u2019s public health spending appears poorly funded in comparison with countries like China, Sri Lanka and \nThailand, for which this proportion was 1.95%, 1.8% and 3.06% respectively. \n3. National rural health mission \nOne of the most significant developments in the public health financing system \nof the country in recent years has been the introduction of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). This scheme aims to reduce the gap between the healthcare available in urban areas and rural areas. \nNRHM bought additional money for the health sector with the help of several \nhealth financing innovations like 'untied funds'. These untied funds enabled the \navailability and access of quality healthcare system to all people, especially \nwho are residing in rural areas.  \nThese funds provide resources to health facilities and community level bodies \nwithout earmarking to line items. They can spend these funds, within the guidelines of the program on virtually any area where the facility requires. NRHM also attempted integration of the vertical disease control programs under \na single umbrella.  \nExample \nNRHM has strengthened the infrastructure of public health facilities in rural \nareas in terms of equipment, structure and human resources. The other key focus area of the mission wa s delegating the powers to the facilities to hire \nspecialist doctors on contract basis. NRHM also introduced a grassroots level link worker in villages, the ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) worker, who is a volunteer from the community, trained by the public health system and act as a \nlink of the community with the public health system. \n4. Problems of access and service quality \nThe guide-lines for national health planning in India were provided by a number \nof committees dating back to the Bhore committee in 1946. It laid the foundations of a comprehensive primary health care delivery system in the country, not too different from the National Health Service in UK and other such tax-funded health provision models in many countries.  \nOver the last six decades, India did attempt to build up an extensive public \nhealth infra-structure at primary, secondary and tertiary levels, with mixed \nsuccess.  \n\nCHAPTER 2  HEALTH FINANCING SYST EM IN INDIA AND ITS PROBLEMS \n32 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE The public health sector continues to face problems like poorly motivated \nmanpower, inadequacy of funding, skewed geographical distribution and other access issues.  \nThe problem of access to healthcare is even more pronounced in rural and \nremote areas, where qualified providers from the private sector are also conspicuous by their absence. In the urban areas, though private providers are available in plenty, but there also they continue to be poorly regulated for pricing and quality, despite a multitude of legislations having been enacted for the health sector.  \nThe absence of any significant influence from large organized purchasers of \nhealthcare (like insurance mechanisms or the government itself) has also \ncontributed to the situation where there is virtually no check on what a provider can charge for healthcare services, and often no check even on the quality of services rendered. \n5. Need for financial protection and advantages of health insurance \nmechanisms  \nWhile  is a substantial awareness of health insurance being a mechanism for \nfinancial protection of the members to meet costs of their healthcare, but it is important to remember that health insurance also has the potential to influence healthcare provider behaviour. We have earlier discussed about supply side and demand side moral hazards.   \nHealth insurance itself contributes to this risk by providing increased access to \nhealthcare system to many people, who would otherwise be not able to afford \nsuch healthcare by overcoming the cost barrier.  \nMoreover, health insurance schemes can have a negotiating power by acting as a \nlarge purchaser of healthcare facilities, something which an individual without insurance otherwise cannot achieve.  \nHowever, poorly designed health insurance system can influence the healthcare \nproviders pushing up the costs. . This will result in reduced access to the \nhealthcare for the uninsured people and thus, has implications on the \naccessibility, costs and quality of healthcare. \nTest Yourself 3\nHow much is the share of government spending on the total health expenditure in our country?  \nI.

Innovative health insurance products in India \n\nCHAPTER 3  ATTRIBUTES OF INDIAN HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n38 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Look at this Scenario \nIn India, the health insurance sector has undergone many changes up until the \nopening of the market for private insurance companies in 2001. By the end of \n2009, there were over 30 insurers (including non-life insurers, standalone health \ninsurers and life insurers) which were together offering more than 300 different \nproducts, though most of them being hospitalisation indemnity procedures. But \nwith increasing competition in the market, insurers are now coming up with a \nnew variety of coverage of items and innovative products to fulfill the needs of \nvarious sections of the population.  \nMore and more people are now looking for and opting for health insurance \nproducts to secure themselves against the skyrocketing medical costs. In order \nto make health insurance products affordable, insurers are also innovating and \nfocusing on new cost sharing techniques. But at the same time, with lots of \nproducts coming in the market, it is confusing for an individual to select a \nhealth insurance policy which will cater best to his/her medical requirements.  \nThis chapter will discuss the characteristics of various health insurance products \navailable in the Indian market.  \nA. Attributes of Indian health insurance products \n1. Health insurance products in India  \nGeneral Insurance Corporation of India, which comprised of four public sector \ninsurance companies, was initially the largest public sector organisation that offered health insurance products in India. Later in 2001, the health insurance sector was opened up for the private sector  players, which led to many more  \ncompanies entering  the health insurance market, and all of them introduced  \nconsiderable  innovations in their offerings. \nWe will now discuss some of the health insurance product types now available in \nIndia are discussed in this chapter.. All the products mentioned discussed below are available in individual (or retail) and also in group variants, where applicable.  \n2. Hospitalisation indemnity products \nMediclaim was the first standardised health insurance product that was \nlaunched in the Indian market to provide coverage for hospitalisation expenses up to a pre-defined annual limit of indemnity. Since then, health insurance in the Indian context has been dominated by this category - known as \u2018hospitalisation indemnity\u2019 products. These products protect individuals from the expenditure they may need to incur in the event of hospitalisation. In most \no f  t h e  c a s e s ,  i t  a l s o  c o v e r s  a  s p e c i f i c  n u m b e r  o f  d a y s  b e f o r e  a n d  a f t e r  \nhospitalisation, but excludes any expenses not involving hospitalisation.  \n\nATTRIBUTES OF INDIAN HEALTH INSURA NCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 3 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  39Such a cover is provided on an \u2018indemnity\u2019 basis, that is, by making good part or \nall of the losses incurred or amount spent during hospitalisation. This may be compared with the insurance coverage on benefit basis, where the amount that will be paid on the occurrence of a certain event (like hospitalisation, diagnosis \nof critical illness or each day of admission) is predetermined in the insurance \npolicy and is not related to the actual expenditure incurred. Thus, it covers the hospitalisation expenses for an individual up to the sum assured. \nExample \nRaghu has a small family consisting of his wife and a 14 year old son. He has taken three Mediclaim policies, one for each member of his family, from a health insurance company for an individual cover of Rs. 1 lakh each. All the three policies are independent, and all of them could get recovery of medical expenses up to Rs. 1 lakh in case of hospitalisation.  \nRaghu was hospitalised due to heart attack and required surgery.

These \naspects are covered in more detail in Chapter 5.  \nSome of the specific exclusions  which are not covered by any of the \nhospitalisation insurance policies are: \na) War/invasion  \nb) Venereal diseases and HIV/AIDS  c) Fertility or assisted conception \nd) Cosmetic or aesthetic procedures  \ne) Intentional self-injury f) Influence of intoxicating drugs or alcohol  \ng) Adventure sports  h) Personal comfort  i) Convenience items  \nHowever, some of these products differ from each other according to the \nextent of their coverage  such as maternity, dental treatment, non-\nallopathic treatment etc.  \nc) Waiting periodThese policies also provide for a certain waiting period, which mostly is an \ninitial waiting period of 30 days before any benefits commence.  For some of the specific diseases or procedures, this waiting  period is 12 to 48 months, \nand such lists may also vary.  \nExample \nMira had taken a health insurance policy for coverage of expenses in the event \nof hospitalisation. The policy had a clause for initial waiting period of 30 days. \nUnfortunately, 20 days after she took the policy, Mira contracted malaria and \nwas hospitalised for 5 days. She had to pay heavy hospital bills. \nWhen she asked for reimbursement from the insurance company, they denied, \nbecause the disease (event) occurred within the waiting period of 30 days from \ntaking the policy. \n\nATTRIBUTES OF INDIAN HEALTH INSURA NCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 3 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  41d) Cost-sharing mechanisms\nMoreover, policies also differ according to the various cost-sharing \nmechanisms used by them, like sub-limits on room and ICU charges, sub-\nlimits on payments made for specific surgeries like cataract or \nhysterectomy, co-payment for using non-network hospitals or even for network hospitals etc. These techniques are also being provided in insurance policies as mechanisms to contain costs for the insurer and to provide for higher spending being shared by the insured.  \nExample \nSomen has taken a mediclaim policy of Rs. 2 lakhs for covering costs in the event of hospitalisation. The policy had a list of network hospitals mentioned in it, which states that if the insured visits any of the in-network hospitals, it will \ncover 90% of the expenses on occurrence of the event and 10% will be his co-\npay, i.e. he will have to pay 10% from his own pocket. However, if he visits a hospital which is out-of-network, then the insurance company will pay only 80% of the expenses and the insured will have to pay the remaining 20% from his pocket.\nMoreover, there was another clause in the policy stating that in case of any \nhospitalisation, the company will cover room charges only up to 1% of the sum \nassured for a day. It means that the insurance company will pay room charges \nonly up to Rs 2000 a day (i.e. 10% of the sum assured of Rs 2 lakhs) in the event of hospitalisation.  \nThese are examples of cost sharing mechanisms used by insurance companies. \n3. Personal accident \nPersonal accident policies are offered both on a standalone basis and in a \npackaged product with other health insurance cover. This policy protects the \ninsured against accidental death and any form of disablement due to accident. It provides for features like a lump sum benefit payout in the event of death or permanent disablement, and a weekly compensation for temporary disablement.  \nThus, unlike the hospitalisation indemnity products, this policy usually does not \nprovide for coverage towards cost of treatment of the insured. However, some \nof these policies provide optional medical coverage, which covers certain \noutpatient expenses for accidents, in addition to inpatient coverage.  \nMoreover, newer personal accident policies are also coming in the market with \na whole new range of innovative components - e.g. the cost of modification of the house or vehicle to meet the medical needs of the insured after a disabling accident.\n\nCHAPTER 3  ATTRIBUTES OF INDIAN HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n42 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Example \nVijay met his old group of friends one day, and the discussion came to the \nvarious insurance policies and their benefits. One of his friends, Rahul, asked him if he had taken any personal accident policy. Vijay asked why he needs such a policy when he already has a life insurance policy with sufficient cover. Rahul advised him that with the increasing number of vehicles in the city, the \naccidents are also increasing, which has obviously increased this risk. \nRahul explained that a health insurance policy will cover the cost incurred in \ncase of hospitalisation, and a life insurance policy will cover the risk associated with death. But if a person dies in an accident, the dependents of the insured will get a lump sum payment from the personal accident policy, along with the life insurance assured sum. This policy is more relevant where the accident results in permanent or temporary disability to the insured. In such cases, it not \nonly covers the risk related to the partial or total disablement by providing \nlump sum payment, but also provides weekly compensation in some cases.  \nThe premium for such policies is quite low. This convinced Vijay, and he \ndecided to take a personal accident policy for himself as soon as possible. \n4. Critical illness \nDreaded diseases like cancer, heart attack, coma or major organ failure may be \nquite infrequent, but are associated with extremely high costs of healthcare. \nMoreover, such costs include a substantial component that may not be covered \nunder the hospitalisation indemnity products. This could be because of exceeding of the sum insured due to the very high costs involved, or high outpatient (ambulatory) expenditure not covered under hospitalisation insurance etc. There could also be need for additional expenses like long term nursing care or home-based nursing.  \nSuch expenses can be financially devastating for the household where the \ncritical illness occurs. Therefore, critical illness products have been introduced to insure against such diseases and to cover the high expenditure related to their treatment. \nCritical illness benefit products provide a lump sum amount to the insured on \nthe diagnosis of a specific critical illness or on undergoing of certain procedures. Thus, it does not cover the actual cost of treatment but pays only \nthe lump sum amount agreed irrespective of whether that amount had been \nincurred or not.  \n\nATTRIBUTES OF INDIAN HEALTH INSURA NCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 3 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  43Critical illness benefit products, again, are available as standalone products or \nas riders to life and non-life policies, or as a component of a packaged health insurance product. They also provide for high sum insured limits, ranging up to several million rupees of lump sum payouts. Some of these policies have a \ndisease specific variant, for example, the cancer insurance policy provides \nprotection only in the case of cancer and not for other critical illnesses. These policies are priced attractively for a high amount of coverage, and are on indemnity basis and not as a lump sum payout.  \nSome of the critical illness indemnity products reimburse certain costs due to \ncritical illnesses rather than providing a lump sum payout, and are therefore priced lower than other such products. \nTest Yourself 1\nMediclaim policy covers the ____________expenses of an individual up to a pre-defined annual limit of indemnity. \nI. Doctor\u2019s consultation \nII. Medicine III. Hospitalisation IV. Surgery and operation theatre  \nTest Yourself 2\nWhich of the following statements about critical illness products is false? \nI. They provide insurance against dreaded diseases such as cancer, heart \nattack or kidney failure. \nII. They cover the actual cost of treatment related to critical illnesses. \nIII. They are available as standalone products or as a packaged health insurance \nproduct.\nIV.

This payment can be used to share any medical \nor non-medical expenses which are normally not covered under hospitalisation policies but account for a substantial part of the overall cost incurred during treatment.\nHospital cash plans are available on a standalone basis, and also as an optional \ncomponent of some packaged health insurance policies. Thus, at a nominal premium, this product provides a daily allowance which is in addition to the \nindemnity claim and is unlinked to the actual expenditure incurred. These \nproducts are particularly useful for persons covered for health by employers, where employers\u2019 health schemes may not bear many of the incidental costs associated with hospitalisation. \nExample \nMost of the hospital indemnity products have a sub-limit on the room rent based on the sum insured, such as 1% or 2% of the sum insured. In this case, if the insured wants to avail a higher category room on being admitted, he will have to pay from his own pocket.  \nBut if he has taken a daily hospital cash benefit policy along with the \nhospitalisation policy, he could utilise the amount of daily allowance to avail a higher category room and also to meet other incidental expenses such as \ntravelling, food etc., thus avoiding payment from his pocket. \n2. High-deductible hospital indemnity covers \nA new option that is available for persons who are either covered by their \nemployers, or are already holding a hospitalisation policy but with low sum \ninsured \u2013 is high-deductible cover for individuals (and families). These are top-up covers which provide coverage beyond the deductible amount chosen at the proposal stage. This threshold ranges from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakhs and the coverage of this product starts only after the out-of-pocket expenses or any existing insurance cover has reached this selected deductible amount.  \n\nINNOVATIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS IN INDIA  CHAPTER 3 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  45These products are cost-effective because their premiums are low due to high \ndeductible amount, making this coverage more affordable. The higher the deductible, the lower will be the insurance premiums, as the chances of a person reaching the high level of deductible are very less. This plan is suitable \nparticularly for those persons who have a low sum insured in indemnity policies \nand want to secure themselves against high medical expenses. \nExample \nVaibhav has taken a basic health insurance policy with a cover of Rs.2 lakhs. One of his close relative died due to heart attack and their family had to pay heavy hospital bills of around Rs. 5 lakhs, which created a huge financial burden on the deceased\u2019s family. \nThis upset Vaibhav and he started thinking that with the changing environment \nand life style; chances of new dreaded diseases are becoming quite high. \nMoreover, with the increasing cost of healthcare, his current coverage will also not be sufficient in case of any emergency. So he wanted to take another health policy, but the cost of another one was not possible for him to bear.  \nAn insurance agent suggested topping up his current plan, which will cost less \nthan taking a new insurance policy. So, he opted for an affordable top-up plan with a sum insured of Rs.5 lakhs and a threshold limit of Rs.3 lakhs. It means \nthat in case of any emergency, the policy benefit of Rs. 5 lakhs will kick-in only \nonce he has used his basic health insurance policy limit of Rs. 2 lakhs and paid \nRs.1 lakh from his pocket (i.e. after reaching the threshold limit of 3 lakhs).  \n3. Disease management covers \nFor patients already suffering from chronic diseases like diabetes, new products \nare now available in the market, which are based on the disease management platform. These products include coverage for some medicines and regular \nlaboratory tests on OPD basis, in addition to other coverage in the product. This \ncategory of products is still in its early stages in India and may develop further in the days to come.  \n4. Outpatient coverage \nMany of the health insurance products that are available in the market provide \ncoverage only in case of hospitalisation for at least 24 hours. But, there are \nmany cases of primary care or small procedures where hospitalisation is not \nrequired or is required for less than 24 hours. In such cases, the insured has to pay expenses from his pocket even if he has a health insurance policy. \nTherefore, now insurers are making increasing efforts to include this outpatient \ncoverage in some form as part of the health insurance products, though these efforts are still in the early stages and will evolve in the days to come.  \n\nCHAPTER 3  INNOVATIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS IN INDIA \n46 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE A s  o f  n o w ,  i f  t h e  p o l i c y  o f f e r s  O P D  c o v e r ,  i t  i s  l i k e l y  t o  c o m e  a t  a  s i z e a b l e  \npremium today, as the insurers expect that much or the entire OPD sum insured will be utilised by the insured. This may change in future as and when insurers \nare able to network OPD providers and negotiate for lower costs with them, and \nfind other ways to reduce the moral hazard problems in OPD coverage. \n5. Investment products and health savings accounts Yet another concept which may take off in some time, are insurance linked \nsavings plans, also known as Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)\n27 or Medical Savings \nAccounts.In countries like Singapore and China, these plans are widely used, while these \nare also operational in South Africa, US and many other countries.  \nA deferred indemnity product, which is similar to the purpose of the HSA, has \nbeen marketed by the public sector insurers in India as \u2018Bhavishya Arogya\u2019 since early 1990s. Bhavishya Arogya is also a hospitalisation product, but it can be effectively bought in younger ages to build up health protection for older age. This product also provides an opportunity to avail tax advantages.  \nLife insurers have also recently launched products with Health Savings \ncomponents, and this may increase in popularity in due course. Under these plans, a portion of the premium collected is used for risk coverage or for meeting claims and the unutilised portion of the premium, which is not used, does not lapse, but is accumulated as savings. These savings could be a solution for the challenges faced by senior citizens later in obtaining affordable health insurance.  \nIn practice, HSAs are usually combined with a high-deductible or catastrophic \nhealth insurance. HSAs can meet costs of frequent, low-cost episodes of illnesses (like outpatient consultations, diagnostics and medicines, or low-cost \nhospitalisation). On the other hand, the high-deductible insurance protects HSA \nbeneficiaries from major illnesses which could cost beyond their savings in HSAs.\n6. Senior citizens\u2019 products Some specific products which meet the needs of senior citizens have been made \navailable by public as well as private insurance companies. These products allow entry till a higher age (even up to 80 years in some products) and a continued renewal till ages as high as 80 or 90 years. These products incorporate cost-sharing features like co-payments and sub-limits to keep a check on the claims as the chances of medical claims in this age are \ncomparatively very high.  \n                                             \n27 Nagpal S, Gautam R N, Singh P.

IPH/ \nWorld Health Organization. 2006. \n\nINNOVATIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS IN INDIA  CHAPTER 3 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  47Due to such cost sharing features, premiums are also lower than the other \nhospitalisation products available in the market for the same age group. However, this product is still in its early stages in India as the insurance companies are not very keen on offering cover to senior citizens. \n7. Micro-insurance products Micro-insurance products are specifically designed to aim for the protection of \nlow income people from rural and informal sectors. The low income people form \na sizable part of our population and usually don\u2019t have any health security \ncover. Therefore, this low value product, with an affordable premium and benefit package, is initiated to help these people to cope with and recover from common risks. \nThese products come with a small premium and typically, the sum insured is \nbelow Rs.30,000, as required vide the IRDA micro-insurance regulations, 2005. Mostly, such covers are taken on a group basis by various community organizations or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for their members. The IRDA\u2019s rural and social sector obligations also require that insurers should sell a \ndefined proportion of their policies as micro-insurance products, to enable \nwider reach of insurance. \n8. International coverage products \nA short term option available for protection against health contingencies \noccurring during international travel are the Overseas Medical Insurance plans. These are mostly packaged as overseas travel plans by including other components like loss of baggage and cover for flight cancellation etc.  \nThe cost of unexpected medical treatment during an overseas visit can be very \nhigh and could indeed be beyond the means of the overseas traveller.", "start_char_idx": 92366, "end_char_idx": 101807, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45fe18c3-772f-49f2-83fc-2d3601339411": {"__data__": {"id_": "45fe18c3-772f-49f2-83fc-2d3601339411", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "057cb52b-913a-410d-be3b-1e00c368e48e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6ee1e46166e1b23fb335027142acaa2a4b3db8d2f05be864ab054b6c133ecee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c95dbbb0-06f6-4091-952d-65841c753618", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9cb4d790bdfa02983d64b15cf078d20887a8edf05a812bbd5418f40d9846d4c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "849cffd1-35d2-461a-b725-912d2473e272", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c06cec4ad6ac386522438c5337a08cbd0b15aefa36d7f855c79e2bf393c0213", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "19edf9b4-d679-46e2-8cae-b1cc32deecd4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "883110143a2ed7a34a7bc9b2994f02fbd9e62050129e03f2d3cc2bfcc7562198", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "32095fdf-e946-4765-b01b-7f4d65b1d9de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b48a30c42e130dcd6bd0028b98a25e9ee62b33229742d1105375f561bf73055", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "fb56e11c-4bd8-4975-95b3-d017483de37d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b67fa12b1ab56a0858b4e5713a7e280986c9e216fe6786862daae0a0bd1cd49c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Overseas \nmedical insurance covers such unforeseen health related contingencies and protects the insured person from high costs of medical attention when travelling outside India.  \nIndeed, some countries insist on having a valid medical insurance as part of the \nvisa documentation.

He went to an insurance company, where they \ngave him an application form in which he was required to answer lot of \nquestions related to his physical built and health, mental health, pre-existing \nillnesses or conditions, his family health history, habits and many more.   \nHe was also required to submit many documents such as age proof, income \nproof and previous medical records.  \nThen they told him to undergo a health check-up and some medical tests which \nfrustrated him.  \nAlex started thinking that he is a quite healthy person and is earning also well, \nso why he has to go through all this lengthy process? Even after going through all \nthis process and waiting periods, insurance company told him that high \ncholesterol and high BP has been diagnosed in his medical tests, which increases \nthe chances of heart diseases later. Though they offered him policy but at a \nvery high premium, which he refused. \nHere, the insurance company was following all these steps as part of their \nprocess. While providing risk coverage, they need to evaluate risks properly and \nthey also need to make reasonable profit. If the risk is not assessed properly and there is a claim, it will result in a loss.  \nInsurance companies try to insure people who will pay adequate premium in \nproportion to the risk they bring to the insurance pool. This process of collecting and analysing information from a proposer for the risk selection is known as underwriting.

Conversely, morbidity also decreases due \nto certain favorable factors. \n\nWHAT IS UNDERWRITING?  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  55Definition \nUnderwriting  is the process of assessing the risk appropriately and deciding the \nterms on which the insurance cover is to be granted. Thus, it is a process of risk \nselection and risk pricing. \n2. Need for underwriting \nUnderwriting is the backbone of an insurance company as acceptance of the risk \nindiscriminately or for inadequate premiums will lead to insurer\u2019s insolvency. On the other hand, being too selective or conservative will restrain insurance \nc o m p a n y  f r o m  c r e a t i n g  a  b i g  p o o l  s o  a s  t o  s p r e a d  t h e  r i s k  u n i f o r m l y .  I t  i s  \ntherefore critical to strike an appropriate balance between risk and business thereby maintaining the competitiveness and yet profitability for the organisation. This process of balancing is done by the underwriter, in accordance with the philosophy, policies and risk appetite of the insurance company concerned. The job of the underwriter is to classify the risk and decide the terms of acceptance at appropriate price. It is therefore important t o  n o t e  t h a t  a c c e p t a n c e  o f  r i s k  i s  l i k e  g i v i n g  a  p r o m i s e  o f  f u t u r e  c l a i m  \nsettlement to the insured.   \n3. Underwriting \u2013 risk assessment \nUnderwriting is a process of risk selection which is based upon the \ncharacteristics of a group or individual. Here based on the degree of the risk represented, the underwriter decides whether to accept the risk and at what price. Under any circumstances, the process of acceptance has to be done with \nfairness and on an equitable basis i.e. every similar risk should be classified \nequally without any prejudice. This classification is normally done through the standard morbidity charts whereby every represented risk is quantified and \npremiums are calculated accordingly. \nFurther, unlike clinical protocols, the insurance risk assessment is based on \nprognosis. Hence based on the type of coverage,   the classification is accordingly done. As we are aware mortality usually comes much after \nmorbidity does. Hence, it is quite logical that the underwriting norms and \nguidelines are much tighter for morbidity coverage than mortality. Therefore, the morbidity premiums are usually steeper than mortality premiums and can increase multifold based on the degree of risk.    \n\nCHAPTER 4  WHAT IS UNDERWRITING? \n56 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Example \nAn individual who is diabetic has a far higher chance of developing a cardiac or \nsystemic complication requiring hospitalisation than of death, and also health episodes can happen multiple times during the course of insurance coverage. A life insurance underwriting guideline might rate this individual as an average cost risk.  However, for medical underwriting, he would be rated higher. \nTherefore, the morbidity premiums will be high and can increase multifold \nbased on the degree of risk. \nIn health insurance, there is a higher focus on medical or health findings than \nfinancial underwriting. However, the latter cannot be ignored as there has to be \nan insurable interest and financial underwriting is important to rule out any adverse selection and ensure persistency in health insurance. \n4. Factors which affect morbidity  The factors which affect morbidity (risk of falling ill) and should be considered \ncarefully while assessing risk are as follows: \na) Age: The premiums are charged commensurate with age and the degree \nof risk. For e.g. the morbidity premiums for infants and children are higher than young adults due to increased risk of infections and accidents. Similarly, for adults beyond the age of 45 years, the premiums are steeper, as the probability of an individual suffering from a chronic ailment like diabetes, a sudden heart ailment or other such morbidity is much higher. \nb) Gender: Women are exposed to additional risk of morbidity during child \nbearing period.\nc) Habits: Consumption of tobacco, alcohol or narcotics in any form has a \ndirect bearing on the morbidity risk.\nd) Occupation: Extra risk to accidents is possible in certain occupations, \ne.g. driver, blaster, aviator etc. Likewise, certain occupations may have \nhigher health risks, like an X-Ray machine operator, asbestos industry workers, miners etc. \ne) Family history: This has greater relevance, as genetic pre-disposition \n(e.g. asthma, diabetes, certain cancers etc.) does impact the morbidity and should be taken into consideration while accepting risk. \nf) Build:  Stout, thin or average may also be associated with morbidity in \ncertain groups. \n\nBASIC PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS FOR UNDERWRITING  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  57g) Past illness or surgery: It has to be ascertained whether the past illness \nhas any possibility of causing increased debility or impairment and accordingly the policy terms should be decided. For e.g. kidney stones are known to recur and similarly, cataract in one eye increases \npossibility of cataract in the other eye. \nh) Current health status and other factors or impairments: This is \nimportant to ascertain the degree of risk and insurability and can be established by appropriate disclosure and medical examination. \ni) Environment and residence: These also have a bearing on morbidity \nrates.  \nTest Yourself 1\nUnderwriting is the process of ___________. \nI. Marketing insurance products \nII. Collecting premiums from customers III. Risk selection and risk pricing IV. Selling various insurance products \nB. Basic principles and tools for underwriting \n1. Basic principles of underwriting \nWhat is not generally known to us is that in any forms of insurance whether life \ninsurance or general insurance, there is legal attire interwoven with several \nprinciples of insurance, with common law and with specific laws on insurance \nalong with judicial pronouncements. Health insurance is equally governed by these principles and any violation of the principles results in the insurer deciding to avoid the liability, much to the dissatisfaction and frustration of the policyholders. These core principles form an integral part to any insurance contract.   \na) Utmost good faith (Uberrima fides)\nWhen one enters into a contract, in our case, an insurance contract, the \ns a m e  i s  b a s e d  o n  u t m o s t  g o o d  f a i t h .  I n  a  c o n t r a c t  b o t h  t h e  p a r t i e s  a r e  obliged to disclose all material information which may be of importance whether or not it is requested. Without utmost good faith, an insurance c o n t r a c t  w o u l d  t a k e  t h e  f o r m  o f  a  w a g e r  o r  a  g a m b l i n g  t r a n s a c t i o n .  T h e  insurer, who undertakes to cover the risk, should be in a position to properly understand the risk.  \n\nCHAPTER 4  BASIC PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS FOR UNDERWRITING \n58 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Any non-disclosure or misrepresentation of a material fact by the proposer \nwould make the contract \u201cvoidable\u201d and the insurer can cancel the contract. This is because the understanding of the insurer about the party to the contract is different from what actually should have been known for \nproper assessment of risk. Materiality of the information not disclosed is \njudged by its relevance to underwriting of the risk.  \nThe duty of utmost faith (Uberrima fides) has to be followed by the insured \nas well as the insurer (when the latter is obliged to the insured once a claim has been lodged under an insurance policy). The parties to the contract must show abundant good faith, absolute and perfect openness and honesty. \nb) Insurable interest\nIt means that a person should have a pecuniary interest in the asset he is \ngoing to get insured and will suffer financial loss in the event of any damage to such asset. Thus, the principle of insurable interest is the legal right to insure and the person taking the insurance has legally recognised relationship to the object of the insurance. In case of health, we all are aware that the greatest wealth or asset of a person is his own health. \nTherefore, a person has a legal right to insure his health by taking a health \ninsurance policy.", "start_char_idx": 110790, "end_char_idx": 119423, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fcb5935-f158-4def-b5ed-90c6b77557fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fcb5935-f158-4def-b5ed-90c6b77557fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c95dbbb0-06f6-4091-952d-65841c753618", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9cb4d790bdfa02983d64b15cf078d20887a8edf05a812bbd5418f40d9846d4c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f44f05a-0843-4740-a4d6-e46d86c2862b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe4b1af1169210dad27e02a0699a72dcd206f58936bfbf44cf923020ab227df4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "3f841ae1-69e5-4d10-ad19-568047f5fa08", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "32052800c0aac7ab1a07d47b8a2424cb301fde7aba4839451d49e1c528495790", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "b145a124-5ac2-44d0-8faf-d0d67f4f6243", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "717bd0cf535bb4b545da1c410f3b0300b4546df60e937b2249720e70ef082c7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "247d4f5a-50f5-437b-9f01-7278a214340a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "583f8916aa24f4291a90a78656f468557374ef8608740549fd5832f3c658d598", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "03c011df-0e78-489e-b900-3d8ea241c7a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "433ee4b64b6bca7b718630ceb80a44fedefc388e1060270316619bfe229b3717", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "b2f836a0-e77d-40ba-996c-3e02427b28c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8e46df8e3605d7f1676ad699e91865c5373fa30ac9069caf445b1e41a102313", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Example \nEmployers buy health insurance plans for their employees because they are deemed to have an insurable interest in the health of their employees in a pecuniary sense (which they lose by death, disablement or sickness of their \nemployees).\nc) Indemnity\nWithout the existence of principle of indemnity, insurance would become a \ngambling transaction in case of non-life contracts. The objective of the insurance is to compensate the insured by placing him in the same financial position after the loss where he was earlier; insurer pays nothing more and nothing less. The insured cannot expect to get anything more than the loss he has actually suffered. He cannot make a profit out of the insurance contract. In contrast, life and personal accident insurances are not contracts of indemnity but benefit policies. In a benefit policy, the sum insured for \nthe possible occurrence is paid no matter what is actually spent.  \nHowever, in an indemnity policy, one is usually compensated for the actual \ncosts or losses, only to the extent of the sum insured. Therefore under the indemnity principle, the occurrence of the insured event does not entitle the insured to compensation unless the insured suffers a monetary loss.  \n\nBASIC PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS FOR UNDERWRITING  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  59Indemnity in all cases will moreover, be limited by: \ni. The sum insured \nii. Limit of liability \niii. Deductible under the policy \niv. Any other cost sharing provisions in the policy \nEven in certain non-life contracts the full sum assured is paid, if the \nassessed loss is equal to or more than the sum insured subject to satisfactory compliance of the terms and conditions of the policy.  \nExample \nRicky has taken a indemnity policy for a cover of Rs.100,000 and has incurred \nhospitalisation expenses due to a minor accident of Rs.40,000. In this case, he \nwill be compensated for the actual cost incurred, i.e. Rs.40,000 and not the \nsum insured, i.e.Rs.100,000. The balance of Rs.60,000 will remain in his account \nwhich he can use for his future coverage. \nd) Contribution\nThese clauses are usually present in all medical insurance contracts. These \nclauses apply when more than one policy covers the same loss. In most cases each insurer\u2019s share of the loss is based on the proportion that its insurance bears to the total amount of insurance (\u2018rateable proportion\u2019 basis).     \nExample \nAmit has taken two hospitalisation indemnity policies, one from X company for a \ncover of Rs.250,000 and another from  Y city for a cover of Rs.150,000.  \nAmit was once hospitalised due to heart attack and incurred hospitalisation \nexpenses of Rs.160,000. The total compensation of Rs.160,000 was shared and paid by both the companies on rateable proportion basis. The share of each company was as follows: \nX Company: 160,000 x 250,000 / (250,000+150,000) = Rs.100,000 \nY Company: 160,000 x 150,000 / (250,000+150,000) = Rs.60,000 \ne) Proximate cause \nThe insurer is liable only if the losses have been caused by the peril insured \nagainst. The principle of proximate cause is applied to determine as to whether the loss was caused by a risk covered, not covered or excluded in the policy. The rule is referred to as \u201ccausa proxima non remota spectator\u201d which means that the proximate and not the remote cause have to be \nlooked into. If the cause of the loss is a peril insured against, the assured \ncan recover the amount of the loss from the insurer.  \n\nCHAPTER 4  BASIC PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS FOR UNDERWRITING \n60 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Another interpretation is that the proximate cause is the dominant cause \nand does not have to be the first. We might describe it as the efficient or operative cause. If there are several causes operating, the proximate one will be dominant one or the most forceful one operating to bring the result. \nIt is the duty of the insured to prove that the loss was due to the insured \nperil, which is proximate. Risks excluded are usually mentioned in the policy under \u201cexclusions\u201d. If the loss is directly or proximately caused by an excluded risk, the claim is not payable.  \nExample \nPeter has taken a basic Mediclaim insurance policy for a cover of Rs. 100,000 in the event of hospitalisation. One day he was admitted to the hospital due to severe abdominal pain. After all th e necessary check-ups and tests, the doctor \ndiagnosed that his liver is damaged due to excessive alcohol consumption and \nhe will have to stay in the hospital for around two weeks for recovery.  \nWhen Peter claimed from his insurance company for the hospitalisation \nexpenses, they denied for it after analysing all the reports and causes for hospitalisation. According to the insurer, the proximate cause for hospitalisation was excessive alcohol drinking which was specifically excluded under the \ncontract; therefore it was not liable to pay any losses.  \n2. Tools for underwriting\nThese are the sources of information for the underwriter, basis on which the \nrisk classification is done and eventually premiums are decided. The following are the key tools for underwriting: \na) Proposal form  This document is the base of the contract where all the critical information \npertaining to the health and personal details of the proposer (i.e. age, \noccupation, built, habits, health status, income, premium payment details \netc.) are collected. This could range from a set of simple questions to a fully detailed questionnaire according to product and the needs/policy of the company, so as to ensure that all material facts are disclosed and the coverage is given accordingly. Any breach or concealment of information by the insured shall render the policy void. \nb) Age proof\nPremiums are determined on the basis of the age of the insured. Hence it is \nimperative that the age disclosed at the time of enrollment is verified through submission of an age proof.  \n\nBASIC PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS FOR UNDERWRITING  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  61Example \nIn India, there are many documents which can be considered as age proof but \nall of them are not legally acceptable. Mostly valid documents are divided into two broad categories. They are as follows: \na) Standard age proof: Some of these include school certificate, passport, \ndomicile certificate, PAN card etc. \nb) Non-standard age proof: Some of these include ration card, voter ID, \nelder\u2019s declaration, gram panchayat certificate etc. \nc) Financial documents\nKnowing the financial status of the proposer is particularly relevant for \nbenefit products and to reduce the moral hazard.

The common forms used for underwriting health insurance business are as below: \n1. Medical underwriting \nMedical underwriting is a process which is used by the insurance companies to \ndetermine the health status of an individual applying for health insurance policy. This health information collected is then evaluated by the insurers to determine whether to offer coverage, up to what limit and on what conditions and exclusions. Thus medical underwriting can determine the acceptance or \ndeclining of a risk and also the terms of cover.  \nHowever, medical underwriting involves high costs in terms of receiving and \nexamining medical reports. Also, when insurers resort to a high degree of medical underwriting, they are blamed for \u2018cream-skimming\u2019 and it reduces the number of people willing to provide the requisite information and detail and to undergo the required tests.  \nHealth status and age are important underwriting considerations for individual \nhealth insurance.", "start_char_idx": 119425, "end_char_idx": 128501, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f44f05a-0843-4740-a4d6-e46d86c2862b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f44f05a-0843-4740-a4d6-e46d86c2862b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0fcb5935-f158-4def-b5ed-90c6b77557fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f0e3a63211ac31b226436f8c451318594acea07d1968e2aaf3e13503b6850b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ea0d26c-48b7-43c6-807e-b2191db36904", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0b201e7ef30ab3ff8ba9cb47e53481b734c6c6c0171d52a40dab6b3e6371fa2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "3c9b6dc5-f3de-4c69-a162-a999e535725a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c854d2e57d009319d91d4eb3c803998b3e921aef42ab945a0a48fcc5c903850", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "a97a48ba-23ce-405c-bce6-05f46c92e8e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "14472c93ee92d111f41992393fbeafb5da8ba747849494a0305282d112064812", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "94a5efe0-c363-4bf5-90a1-1b55e6f66c3f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "20652839a6d2f94701202bfaf51dd7edfa045bef489f02f6e3c491746c6fca57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "ad078705-7972-4138-8a03-6d45cdd98705", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "467355941506aa456f94128a947457651a8f6cb2ab8a0d67a7f0d25e7b52ea62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "c231c715-51a0-4317-9984-6893f256719b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "49c464daed9af1c4520ff0f31971d937133341e5e050b09a64f1227be0d13cb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Health status and age are important underwriting considerations for individual \nhealth insurance. Also current health status, personal and family medical history enable an underwriter to determine presence of any pre-existing diseases or conditions and eventually the probability of future health problems that may require hospitalisation or surgical intervention. \nFurther proposal forms are designed in a manner to elicit information about \npast treatments taken, hospitalisations and surgical interventions undergone, \nwhich help an underwriter to evaluate the possibility of recurrence of an earlier \nailment, its impact on current or future health status or future complications. Some diseases that the proposer may have been medicated for earlier or is on medication presently may lie dormant for a while and recur again.  \n\nUNDERWRITING PROCESS  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  63Example \nMedical conditions like hypertension, overweight/obesity and raised sugar levels \nhave a high probability of future incidences of associated diseases of the heart, kidney and the nervous system. So, these conditions should be carefully \nconsidered while assessing the risk for medical underwriting. \nCurrent health status and age are key underwriting factors for assessment of \ninsurability of an individual for health insurance. Since adverse changes in health status generally occur post 40 years, mainly due to normal ageing process, insurers do not require any medical examination or tests of the \nproposer earlier than the age of 45 years (some insurers could raise this \nrequirement to 50 or 55 years too). Medical underwriting guidelines may also require a signed declaration of the proposer\u2019s health status by his/her family physician.\nIn the Indian health insurance market, the key medical underwriting factor for \nindividual health insurance is the age of the person. Persons above the age of 45-50 years, enrolling for the first time are normally required to undergo \nspecified pathological investigations to assess health risk profile and to obtain \ninformation on their current health status. Such investigations also provide an indication of prevalence of any pre-existing medical conditions or diseases. \nExample \nDrugs, alcohol and tobacco consumption may be difficult to detect and seldom declared by the proposer in the proposal form. Non-disclosure of these poses a major challenge in underwriting of health insurance. Obesity is another problem which threatens to become a major public health problem and underwriters need to develop underwriting tools to be able to adequately price the \ncomplications arising out of the same.  \n2. Non-medical underwriting\nMost of the proposers which apply for health insurance do not need medical \nexamination. If it could be known with a fair degree of accuracy that only one-tenth or less of such cases will bring the adverse results during medical examination, insurers could dispense with medical examination in majority of the cases. Even, if the proposer was to disclose all material facts completely \nand truthfully and the same were checked by agent carefully, then also the \nneed for medical examination could have been much less. In fact, a slight increase in the claims ratio can well be compensated for by the savings in the costs of medical underwriting and other procuring expenses due to the increased inconvenience in completing the proposal forms.  \n\nCHAPTER 4  UNDERWRITING PROCESS \n64 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Therefore, insurance companies are coming up with some medical policies \nwhere the proposer is not required to undergo any medical examination. In such cases, companies usually create a \u2018medical grid\u2019 to indicate at what age and stage should a medical underwriting be done, and therefore these non- medical \nlimits are carefully designed so as to strike an appropriate balance between \nbusiness and risk. \nExample \nIf an individual has to take health insurance coverage quickly without going through a long process of medical examinations, waiting periods and processing delays, then he can opt for a non-medical underwriting policy. In a non-medical underwriting policy, premium rates and sum assured are usually decided on the basis of answers to a few health questions mostly based on age, gender, smoking class, build etc. The process is speedy but the premiums are relatively \nhigher.\n3. Numerical rating method   \nThis is a process adopted in underwriting, wherein numerical or percentage \nassessments are made on each component of the risk.  \nFactors like age, sex, race, occupation, residence, environment, built, habits, \nfamily and personal history are examined and scored numerically based on pre-determined criteria. The facts are not easy to ascertain and prejudice may color \nthe reports. Nevertheless, the basis of the numerical system is logical; it gives a \ndebit or a minus score to the unfavorable aspects of the risk, and gives a credit to the favorable ones. Some combination of debits is much more unfavorable than their numerical summation e.g. Tuberculosis and underweight for instance; heart murmur and rheumatism history; albumin and high blood pressure. In such instances a supplementary debit for association is added or the combination is treated as a unit and conjoined debit applied according to known experience. \nExample \nIn a numerical rating method, an applicant is assumed to start at a point of 100, i.e. 100% of the standard risk. Then, according to his built, family history, occupation, habits and other related factors, points are assigned to each factor \non the basis of rating manual. If the applicant is suffering from any disease such \nas diabetes or high blood pressure, he will get debit points for example 25 points, which will be added to his standard risk. Similarly, if the applicant has an occupation which is safe for any major health risks such as a professor in university or a doctor, then he will get some credit points for it, for example 5 points which will be deducted from his standard risk.  \n\nUNDERWRITING PROCESS  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  65After considering all the factors, all debits and credits are added or subtracted \nto reach the final rating. On the basis of such rating, the applicant is placed under standard, sub-standard or uninsurable risk. In the above case, it will be (100 + 25 \u2013 5 = 120), which means that the applicant is at an extra risk of 20% \nand the policy thus will also be priced accordingly.  \nVery often the impairments are inter-related calling for the summation of only a \nfraction of each debit, and in many cases the debit for one of the impairment can be wholly included in that of another. On the other hand, the combination of certain impairments might indicate a much higher extra morbidity risk than that suggested by the simple addition of the debit for each. \na) Advantages of numerical rating method \nIn a decentralised system of underwriting, the numerical method has \nfollowing advantages: \ni. It ensures consistency between the decisions of different underwriters \nand of the same underwriter at different times. \nii. It results in a more uniform treatment of risks because the judgment of \nthe individual medical selector is steadied and restrained by the use of \nstandards. \niii. The liability to error is greatly reduced by the detailed analysis to which \neach risk is subjected and eliminates personal prejudice. \niv. The work of the medical expert or referee is much lessened because \nmuch of it can be safely entrusted to the trained underwriter. \nv. A more careful analysis of difficult or doubtful cases is made possible \nbecause past experience with reference to the doubtful points is expressed numerically in terms of a known standard and shadings from that past experience either favorable or unfavorable may be more intelligently made. \nvi. Greater speed is possible in the handling of a large business, because as \nmuch as two-thirds of the business may be passed through the hands of the trained personnel without having it brought to the attention of medical experts/referees at all.  \nvii. It facilitates the work of building new statistics. \nviii. It provides a working rule to assess the combined effect of a number of \nimpairments which has stood the test of experience. \nix. Underwriting is practically reduced to application of a formula and can \nbe done by persons without any special knowledge of medical science. \nx. While reviewing a case, one can easily see how the decision was arrived \nat.\n\nCHAPTER 4  UNDERWRITING PROCESS \n66 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE b) However there are some deficiencies of the Numerical rating method :\ni. It has not been possible to fix the percentage of increased claim \nexperience for all adverse features. Hence proposals with these features \nhave still to be referred to medical referee on the basis of special \nreports obtained. \nii. The assumptions that every adverse feature results in a constant \naddition to the morbidity rate and the process of equating the adverse with favorable features will give the net extra morbidity are not always \ncorrect.\niii. The fixing of the extra percentage for each adverse feature is also \narbitrary, though it is consistent. \nIn many cases, the rating manual only gives a range of debits (e.g. 25 to 50%) \nagainst certain impairments but the actual rating depends on the underwriter's judgment regarding the severity of the impairment and other correlated aspects of the risk. Ratings have often to be modified by taking into account the \ninteraction of various aspects of the risk and in particular the probable \ninfluence on the risk of the occupation, habits, mode of living, socioeconomic status, moral hazard, etc. The numerical ratings arrived can only be regarded as a guide but the selection of risk depends to a considerable extent on the individual judgment and skill of the underwriter.", "start_char_idx": 128404, "end_char_idx": 138292, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ea0d26c-48b7-43c6-807e-b2191db36904": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ea0d26c-48b7-43c6-807e-b2191db36904", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f44f05a-0843-4740-a4d6-e46d86c2862b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe4b1af1169210dad27e02a0699a72dcd206f58936bfbf44cf923020ab227df4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2cbf9e6c-100b-4051-aa80-e63fb2f61479", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "10e23fd15b53dc3ea781bfe5ec185ed8bd02ea7a0fd86d1612bea27f90e89580", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "3f471dcd-a338-4367-84e1-fe0a7235c5ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9f8c3888954c46d77a2ea7b7780ab70baedd3d52c2b27d4df1aec876e636fa9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "a153fb02-18eb-4bd3-82f6-cf00de4157ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44d8d5b289e036b1db3b8486b00adb35b428302a175e781c3972753b24ea9cc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "23f3237a-2556-4cc0-b429-258aac57db2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d5848a59d5c9428872dd3b6c0c9fb916c54a07b7cad15c9ad447f24dff639c5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "c8ad7ad5-2839-4ee1-abef-66ece989efc8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00019e5fe0e98251426d4711af22fb8d6c0d2ef4fd6b94631f57abdf2a5f2a22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "30f3cacc-5400-44b6-bb79-fd02f626dffa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1112df5f83cc125ef9b490306a145ca4bde7f5a635723952de01fb08f79d5fce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "The main points requiring consideration when imposing terms to cover an extra \nrisk are firstly  whether the extra risk is of an increasing nature, decreasing or \nconstant; and secondly, whether it is likely to change greatly or not.

Underwriting decisions \nThe underwriting process is completed when the received information is \ncarefully assessed and classified into appropriate risk categories.

Use of general or standard exclusions \nThe majority of policies impose exclusions that apply to all their members. \nThese are known as standard exclusions or sometimes referred to as general exclusions.

Group health insurance\n1. Group health insurance \nGroup insurance is underwritten mainly on the law of averages, implying that \nwhen all members of a homogenous group are covered under a group health insurance policy, the individuals constituting the group cannot anti-select against the insurer. Thus, while accepting a group for health insurance, the insurers take into consideration the existence of a few members in the group who may have severe and frequent health problems. Hence, excepting for group \ncover, if such individuals having severe and frequent health problems were to \nbe underwritten on an individual basis, they would be construed either substandard or uninsurable risks. \nUnderwriting of group health insurance requires analysing the characteristics of \nthe group to evaluate its conformance with the insurance company\u2019s underwriting guidelines as well as the guidelines laid down for group insurance by the insurance regulators.  \nStandard underwriting process for group health insurance requires evaluating \nthe proposed group on the following parameters: \na) Type of group \nb) Group size  \nc) Type of industry \nd) Eligible lives for coverage e) Whether entire group is being covered or there is an option for members \nto opt-out \nf) Level of coverage \u2013 whether uniform or stratified \ng) Composition of the group in terms of sex, age, single or multisite \nlocations, income levels of group members, employee turnover rate, whether premium paid entirely by the group holder or members are required to participate in premium payment \nh) Difference in healthcare costs across regions in case of multi-site \nlocations spread in different geographical locations \ni) Determining preference of the group holder for administration of the \ngroup insurance by a third party administrator (of his choice or one \nselected by the insurer) or by the insurer itself \nj) Past claims experience of the proposed group \n\nGROUP HEALTH INSURANCE  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  71Example \nA group of members working in mines or factories is at higher health risk than a \ngroup of members working in air-conditioned offices. Also the nature of diseases \n(thereby claims) are also likely to be quite different for both groups.  Therefore, the insurer will price the group health insurance policy accordingly in both the cases.  \nSimilarly to avoid adverse selection in case of groups with high turnover such as \nIT companies, insurers can introduce precautionary criteria requiring employees \nto serve their probationary period before becoming eligible for insurance. \nDue to highly competitive nature of group health insurance business, insurers \nallow substantial flexibility and customisation in benefit designing of the group insurance plans. In employer-employee group insurance plans, the benefits design is many a time developed and deployed as an employee retention tool by the human resources department of the employer. Often, the flexibility also \nstems from the need to duplicate or improve on the existing \u2018richer\u2019 benefits \nalready being provided in the existing group insurance plan by another insurer, in a pitch to capture and shift business. \n2. Underwriting other than employer- employee groups Employer-employee groups are traditionally the most prevalent groups offered \nfor group health insurance. However, as health insurance gains acceptance as \nan effective vehicle of financing healthcare expenditure, different types of \ngroup aggregations have evolved. In such a scenario, it is important for group health insurance underwriters to take into consideration the homogeneity and cohesiveness of the group composition while underwriting the group. \nIn addition to employee-employer groups, insurers have provided group health \ninsurance coverage to varied type of groups such as: labour unions, trusts and \nsocieties, multiple-employer groups, franchised dealers, professional \nassociations, clubs and other fraternal organisations. \nGovernments in different countries have been buyers of group health insurance \ncoverage for vulnerable sections of the society.

Such non-employer groups \ninclude: \na) Employer welfare associations \nb) Holders of credit cards issued by a specific company c) Customers of a particular business where insurance is offered as an add-\non benefit \nd) Borrowers of a bank and professional associations or societies \nThe rationale of the group insurance guidelines is to restrict formation of groups \nfor the sole purpose of availing insurance with advantage of  of flexible design, coverage of benefits not available on individual policies and cost savings. It has been observed that such \u2018groups of convenience\u2019 have often led to adverse selection against the insurers and eventually high claim ratios. Group insurance guidelines by the regulatory authority, thus, help in responsible market conduct by the insurers not only in instilling underwriting discipline but also in canvassing group insurance schemes and setting up administration standards for \ngroup schemes. \n3. Use of genetics in underwriting \nThis is a controversial application of the science of Genetics, but underwriters \nof the future may be able to study the genetic information of individuals for health risk assessment. Human DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid), is the \u2018blueprint of life\u2019, which contains the genetic instructions used in the development and \nfunctioning of living organisms, provides an innovative and effective tool to \nunderwriters and actuaries in assessment of the health status of an individual.  \nGenetic abnormalities can be broadly classified as inherited or acquired \n(resulting from mutations caused by aging or the environment). Public concerns about using genetics in underwriting relate to fears of denial or cancellation of coverage by insurers on receiving an individual\u2019s adverse data about his / her genetic composition and affliction. Apprehensions are also raised about the \nprivacy of genetic information as this tells not only about the individual but also \nhis/her family lineage \u2013 both past and future, and its social and economic impact. Further, extensive application of genetic information may also evolve into \u2018cream-skimming\u2019 by insurers in risk selection and underwriting of individual health insurance risk. \nUntil public concerns are suitably addressed and safeguards for privacy of \ngenetic data are put in place, use of genetic information for underwriting of \nindividual health or life risk is presently not permitted in almost all global \ninsurance jurisdictions.  \n\nGROUP HEALTH INSURANCE  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  73For instance, in Britain, for the time being, only one predictive genetic test is \napproved for now to be used in insurance underwriting, that of Huntington\u2019s disease for use in determining premiums for life insurance policies over \u00a3500,000. This, of course, will be an evolving area and will also be an upcoming \ntask for insurance regulators to comprehend and regulate. \nTest Yourself 5\n1) In a group health insurance, any of the individual constituting the group \ncould anti-select against the insurer. \n2) Group health insurance provides coverage only to employer-employee \ngroups.\nI.

Also it \nenables the player or observer of the game to appreciate the rules, respect its sanctity, enjoy the game in a better manner, pass critique on the method of play like an expert, appreciate the facts, involve himself for the improvement o f  t h e  g a m e  a n d  a l s o  e n s u r e  t h a t  a  r u l e  o f  o n e  g a m e  i s  n o t  m i x e d  u p  w i t h  another without proper judgment. For example, one cannot apply the rules of tennis in cricket and play cricket with a tennis bat. However, when children do play cricket matches with a cricket bat and tennis ball, even though a slight \ndeviation is applied, still the philosophy of cricket is not tarnished but it allows \nmany more to participate without fearing any wounds which a cricket ball may cause. Similarly, the set of rules for health insurance policies are the forms and clauses, and this chapter covers the same. Some questions which this chapter aims to answer include \na) What forms the basis of health insurance?  \nb) Why are so many questions asked during the purchase of health \ninsurance policies?  \nc) What are the common clauses that are applicable for health insurance? \nd) What is the need for common definitions and initiatives taken on that \nfront?\nA. Health insurance contract \n1. Health insurance contract \nHealth insurance policy is actually a contract between the insurer and the \ninsured. The word contract is derived from the word \u2018Contrahere\u2019- which means \n\u2018to draw together\u2019 and it stresses the importance of mutuality in the use of the \nparticle or subject, more than the word \u2018Agreement\u2019.  That\u2019s why insurance policies are popularly known as insurance contracts rather than insurance agreements wherein the mutuality of both the parties are stressed based on the principles of \u2018Uberima Fides\u2019 viz. Utmost Good Faith not only at the time of initiation of the contract but also at the time of execution or termination of contract.\nDefinition \nWebster dictionary defines contract as \u201ca binding agreement between two or \nmore persons or parties; especially: one legally enforceable\u201d. \nA contract is supposed to have mandatory elements like: \na) Offer and acceptance  \nb) Consideration\nc) Capacity to contract \nd) Legality of form etc. \n\nHEALTH INSURANCE CONTRACT  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  81Diagram 1: Mandatory elements of a contract  \nInsurance contracts are based on the product features offered by the insurance \ncompany. The product mentions the benefits offered in the event of any loss or the happening of the insured event, specific te rms and conditions governing the \nproduct, consideration (premium) and other inputs in the form of declarations expected from the insured etc. \nExample \nA health insurance contract is based on the principles of contract law and the provisions of the insurance contract. It has all the mandatory elements of a contract.\na) Offer and acceptance:  Health insurance policies offer the benefits of \nproviding coverage in the event of hospitalisation/ illness for a premium that is required to be paid by the customer. \nb) Consideration:  The extent of premium is determined by the inputs & \ndeclarations provided by the customer about their age, health status etc. \nc) Capacity of contract:  Both the parties, insurer and insured should be \nlegally capable of entering into a health insurance contract. \nd) Legality of form:  When a customer buys a health insurance policy; it means \nthat he is signing a contract with the insur ance company to cover his illness \nbased on a mutual consent. \nThe mutual consent comes in the form of the proposal by the customer and its \nacceptance by the insurer. \n2. Insurance contract vs. other contracts  \nOne may wonder why in the case of insurance, the customer normally does not \nhave much say other than accepting most of the conditions of the product. \nSometimes the conditions are written in difficult legal language that it may be very difficult for a person to understand as well.  As insurers cover the risk based on the laws of probability, law of large numbers and other principles of insurance, the insurance company contracts are slightly different from the other contracts.\n\nCHAPTER 5  HEALTH INSURANCE CONTRACT \n82 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE In general, insurance contracts are different from the other contracts through \nthe following ways: \na) Unlike other contracts, the customer may never see the copy of the \ncontract till he receives the policy (though ideally it should not differ \nmuch from the content of the prospectus which the customer should see beforehand). \nb) While in other forms of contracts, the buyer should beware \u2018caveat \nemptor\u2019; however this rule stands modified in insurance contracts by the principle of \u2018utmost good faith\u2019 from both the sides. \nDiagram 2: Insurance contract Vs. Other contract \nTest Yourself 1\nHealth insurance is ___________ between the insurer and the insured. \nI. An agreement  \nII. A contract III. A deal IV. A mutual consent\n\nHEALTH INSURANCE PROPOSAL FORM  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  83B. Health insurance proposal form \nThe proposal form of any health insurance application form can be segregated \ninto two main parts:  \n/g57Details of the applicant  \n/g57Declaration by the applicant  \nAs mentioned earlier, the details provided in the proposal form, build the basis \nfor an insurance contract and the applicant is expected to provide the same with \u2018utmost good faith\u2019. The details given provide the basis for the underwriting of the proposal and the acceptance of the risk by the insurer. \n1. Details of the applicant \nThe applicant details section usually covers the following minimum questions: \na) Name of the applicant with father\u2019s/husband\u2019s name \nb) Date of birth \nc) Sex\nd) Age (in completed years) \ne) Occupation\nf) Sum insured/ plan opted for \ng) Address & telephone number \nh) PAN details \ni) Details of the hospitalisation/illness/disease at present or in the past/ \nlast 4 years \nj) If it is a family floater policy, then the details of the members with their \nrelationship will also be asked.  \nMany people think that why insurers ask for more information than required for \na bank account, or for a new mobile phone connection? The underlying principle is that the data becomes more vital in case of health insurance as it forms part \nof the underwriting process and also the \u2018insurance contract\u2019 wherein in other \ncases; it is just a requirement to register the details of the customer under Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.   \nA person is likely to know more things about himself when compared to others, \nwhich is part of the information asymmetry of health insurance from the insured\u2019s side. The insurance company is entering into an insurance contract to protect his health related risks by trusting his statements in the proposal, which is assumed to be given on the basis of \u2018Utmost Good Faith\u2019.  \n\nCHAPTER 5  HEALTH INSUR ANCE PROPOSAL FORM \n84 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Health related risks can be judged to some extent on the basis of insured\u2019s age, \noccupation, place of residence etc. Based on the past data also, it is assumed that human beings are prone to more diseases when they grow older. Hence age becomes a very important factor while calculating the premium. That\u2019s why the \nstandard premium tables of an insurance company are classified on the basis of \nage.  \nExample \nThe proposal form requires an applicant to fill up the details of his current occupation. By knowing the occupation of the customer, an insurance company is in a better position to forecast any of the occupational hazards.

Hospitalisation indemnity plans \nThis product is offered on individual as well as on group basis. Typically this \npolicy will reimburse the following benefits: \na) Hospital costs: \n/g57Accommodation costs, nursing care, operation theatre expenses \n/g57Specialist consultations and physiotherapy received as in-patient \nb) Specialist fees: \n/g57Surgeon\u2019s and anaesthetist\u2019s fee for in-patient and day care \noperations \n/g57Physician\u2019s fee for in-patient treatment \n/g57Cost of medicines, diagnostics tests etc.  \nPre-existing conditions (conditions the insured had before taking out the \ninsurance) are usually excluded from coverage for a defined period (In 2008, the General Insurance Council decided to cap the waiting period for pre-existing conditions to 4 years which is discussed later in this course).  \nc) These products generally exclude the following: \n/g57Drug abuse \n/g57Self-inflicted injuries \n/g57Out-patient treatment \n/g57HIV/AIDS of sexually transmitted diseases \n/g57Cosmetic surgery (unlinked to burns or cancer) \n/g57Preventive treatment/ immunisations etc. \n/g57Maternity and termination of pregnancy \nUsually, the condition for eligibility for this benefit payment is that the \ninsured has to be hospitalised for at least 24 hours. This is, however, waived for certain defined day-care surgical procedures where due to technological advancement, the patient can undergo surgery and be discharged on the same day (which earlier would have taken a much longer period of hospitalisation). \nSome insurers operate no-claim discount (or no claim bonus) scales for their \nindividual policyholders or offer health check benefits for claim-free \npolicies.\n\nCHAPTER 5  POLICY CLAUSES FOR VA RIOUS HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n88 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Example \nRakesh had taken a health insurance plan in the year 2010 with coverage of Rs. \n1 lakh in the event of hospitalisation. There were few clauses in his health insurance contract for no claim bonus which he has not paid attention at that time. He came to know about these clauses after completion of the first year which pleasantly surprised him. \nHis first year of the policy was a claim free year, i.e. he had made no \nhospitalisation claims from his insurance company. So, the insurance company has increased his basic sum insured by 10%, i.e. Rs.10,000 as a claim free bonus in the next year which increases his total coverage to Rs.110,000. \nHis next year again was a claim free year; therefore as a bonus, company \nprovided him with a free health checkup and also increased his basic sum \ninsured, i.e. increasing his coverage up to Rs.1.2 lakhs. \nRecently, these products have seen the introduction of many cost sharing \nprovisions like:  \ni. Sub-limits on specific components of the hospital costs \nii. Co-payments (also called \u2018co-insurance\u2019) where a defined share of the \ncosts are borne by the insured and  \niii. Deductibles (also called \u2018excess\u2019) where the initial defined amount of \nhospital costs are borne by the policyholder after which the coverage \nstarts.\nThese help to reduce moral hazard, and contribute to lower overall costs for \nthe insurer, which also means that the reduced insurer liability can flow to the customer in the form of reduced premium.  \nDiagram 4: Cost sharing provisions in Health insurance contract \n\n\nPOLICY CLAUSES FOR VA RIOUS HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  892. Critical illness policy \nThanks to medical advances, more and more people are surviving major diseases \nlike cancer, strokes, and heart attacks etc. Medical care has increased life \nexpectancy resulting in people surviving critical illnesses that would have \npreviously resulted in death. This, however, continues to require high amount of medical costs, reduced ability to work and a major change in lifestyle. Thus, \nthe financial security of the individual and his family is severely threatened when a person is diagnosed with a critical illness. The critical illness policy eases the financial pressure by providing a lump sum payment on diagnosis of a covered condition (or on undergoing a covered procedure). The proceeds are a cash benefit and thus can be used by the insured for any purpose.  \nIn the Indian context, life insurance companie s offer this product in two forms: \na) Accelerated CI benefit product, as a rider to a life insurance policy \nb) Stand-alone CI product (also offered now by many non-life and \nstandalone health insurers) \nIn the accelerated CI product, the death benefit is accelerated and the benefit \namount (otherwise payable on death) is paid if the insured is diagnosed of any \nspecified critical illnesses. Under the second type, the benefit is payable on diagnosis of critical illness and is unlinked to any death benefit.  \nExample \nRaghav had taken a life insurance policy for Rs.3 lakhs which included an accelerated critical illness cover of Rs.1 lakh at the age of 25.", "start_char_idx": 167150, "end_char_idx": 176258, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b31f8c12-6164-4040-9e15-3262c108d8d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "b31f8c12-6164-4040-9e15-3262c108d8d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc8b7487-7299-46ab-bf28-398abf3fa61b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e450352eb2f273af4dc4023a00092fa7cc2342bd0dcadd02f0591d96169820b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2b84a25c-177d-4b7d-a4ca-3c81ea9da1fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "80edc3d6ee0ec2dee8f987051c2fd5ab21d90b470adb9f10a518b32f76d17b26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "083bcfc4-31c0-4ff2-a43a-8d54099132bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9fa24a6c2175265194f7f70bfcff4f07f93326e78793039b655dbaf74eec2ea2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "ddf06803-5b0a-4442-b944-b7e74705037e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c071dcb474fe4abc7c91d2447de65931d314e784a271f8191142798f230f46e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "2f400805-4608-47bb-9e07-ca8ffaafa95c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "541af68a26c06a49e19986df00e7feb1c5cb346a8c81ce1e7ceb08c3f58e66dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "f00fcb5e-66d9-4441-8e8d-055069fa6282", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "12958d767bca8c6a9ff64c6ad7f6c06eea12033869a4841d8f793d61a56e3bba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "1b082939-4ab8-4c26-bacd-7103cf8bc873", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4803a028fbaf3109439a1b57a209f86f1258cf9c3158d835e9d7d32935a93e31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "He was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 36 which was covered under his critical illness policy.

The list of covered critical illnesses in any product varies across insurers \nand insurers often design products based on the following factors: \n/g57It is a condition perceived to be serious by potential customers, \nincurs high cost and can hamper their lifestyle. \n/g57Each condition covered can be defined clearly especially in terms of \nits \u2018payout point\u2019 at which the benefit amount becomes payable. \n/g57Sufficient data is available to price the product. \n\nCHAPTER 5  POLICY CLAUSES FOR VA RIOUS HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n90 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE The last mentioned data may not be easy to find in India but currently \nIndian insurers are pricing the products based on reinsurers\u2019 data. Initiatives have also been underway to standardise the nomenclature and definitions of critical illnesses in India so that the products are comparable and can be \nmore readily understood by the potential customers. In many markets (UK, \nMalaysia etc) the definitions of the conditions are already standardised by industry agreement or regulatory action. In India also, IRDA has moved forward in this direction in consultation with the industry. \nii. Common conditions which are cover ed in critical illness policies are: \n/g57Cancer \n/g57Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) \n/g57Heart attack/ Myocardial infarction \n/g57Kidney failure \n/g57Major organ transplant \n/g57Stroke \niii.

Other benefit products  \nBenefit products are increasingly being offered by insurance companies actively \nin the Indian health space, which offer lump sum payouts irrespective of the expenses incurred. Some examples include the following: \na) Hospitalisation daily cash allowance : or its variants allowing higher cash \nallowance for accidents or ICU stay (benefit of Rs.X  in addition) \nb) Convalescence or recuperation benefit: in case of continuous \nhospitalisation for more than X days at a stretch, the policy provides a lump sum cash benefit. \nc) Surgical benefit: provides pre-determined cash benefit for undergoing \nthe covered surgeries, though regardless of actual expenditures. \nd) Personal accident benefit and disability benefit \n\nPOLICY CLAUSES FOR VA RIOUS HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  91None of the reimbursement or indemnity health insurance policies meet 100 per \ncent of the expenses incurred due to a hospitalisation. For instance, the expenses on attendant\u2019s food, visitor charges, etc., are not covered by the policies. The customer will be out of office during hospitalisation and there are \nchances that he will incur loss of pay. The allowances are expected to offset his \nloss of income and other such incidental costs. \nThe principle of \u2018contribution\u2019 is only applicable to indemnity policies and not \nto the benefit type covers. Thus, a person may hold two policies of benefit type from two different companies, and his payable amount from each insurer does not get reduced, rather the two will get added.  \n4. Disability benefit plans or income protection plans \nDisability benefit plans are also known as income protection plans (IP).  This \nproduct protects and covers the loss of income when the insured is unable to pursue his occupation due to injury or illness.   \nSuch products can be designed with different structure of benefit payments. \nThe benefit i.e., income payment during the period of incapacity can be level or increasing. Nowadays many insurers are offering increasing level of benefit payment to suit the increasing level of salary or inflation. The benefit escalation may come with increased premium or level premium throughout the \npolicy term.  \nExample \nAs we all know that life is uncertain, a person who is earning good and living \nhappily with his family can instantly lose his ability to earn income due to a sudden accident or illness. A normal health insurance policy can help a person to pay his medical bills, but it would not help him to replace his income which he lost due to not attending his job. \nA disability benefit plan can help in such condition by providing income to a \nperson when he is unable to work due to accident or illness to meet his daily \nexpenses.\nIn India, this product is currently available only as a component of \ncomprehensive personal accident policies from some of the non-life insurers or is available from life insurers as a rider to life insurance products, called as \u201cAccident and disability benefit rider\u201d. \nIn either case, this provides for a fixed income (related to the sum assured \nunder the insurance policy) during the period of incapacity due to accident (but \nnot due to ill health) subject to a maximum payout period as laid down in the policy. Illness related IP covers are yet to find their way in the Indian market. \n\nCHAPTER 5  POLICY CLAUSES FOR VA RIOUS HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n92 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE 5. Long term care plan \nLong-term care includes all forms of continuing personal or nursing care for \npeople who are unable to look after themselves without a degree of support and \nwhose health is not likely to get better in future.   \nThe long-term care costs can be divided into three broad categories.  \na) Personal care costs like the additional costs incurred for being looked \nafter by nurses or skilled personnel \nb) Living costs like food, clothing, amenities etc \nc) Housing costs  \nLTC insurance has evolved with an aim to indemnify the insured for the \nadditional costs incurred when they are in need of long-term care. It is a new concept and is still evolving in developed markets. LTCI plans can be classified based on method of funding.  \na) Pre-funded plans  \nUnder these plans, the insured will pay the premium when the insured is in \nhealthy condition. The premium payment can be for a certain period or for life time. The benefit payment is dependent on claim definition. The claim trigger may be defined based upon impact on Activities of Daily Living (ADL\u2019s) or more restrictive definitions can be used. The more restrictive the definition, the lesser will be the premium as there will be less likelihood of incidence of claim. \nb) Immediate needs plans\nThese plans are purchased by a lump sum payment when the insured is \nrequiring long term care. The severity of disability will decide the quantum of benefit. The more is the disability, the more will be the benefit as the expected survival period requiring long-term care will be lesser.  \nThis product concept is relatively new. The market for this product is \ndeveloping rapidly in developed markets. In India the market for this product (at the time of writing this course) is yet to be developed. However, with development of nuclear families, changing culture, and developing economy the product will find market in the coming years.  \n\nPOLICY CLAUSES FOR VA RIOUS HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  936. Health savings or investments linked plans \nHealth insurance in India is largely a pure risk product without any investment \nreturns. Recently, some life insurance companies have launched Unit Linked \nHealth Insurance plans. In this plan, the total premium is split up into risk \npremium and investment amount. While the risk premium is allocated for the health insurance coverage, the investment amount is diverted to the unit linked funds which can pay for the future health costs or for the costs like OPD not covered in the risk component. The products may also offer other benefits like hospitalisation allowances, critical illness benefits etc.  \nInternationally, there are products called as Health Savings Account (HSA) which \naccumulate an amount to be utilised when the account holder needs to spend \non health care, i.e. usually at the senior age. These products encourage savings for expected high costs of medical care in the future. Individuals are personally conscious of costs so help reduce moral hazard and may mobilise greater funds for health. \nHowever, savings alone are generally not high enough to protect a person from \nunexpectedly high cost diseases or chronic conditions. To avoid this, HSA\u2019s are \noften offered together with a catastrophic health insurance plan to cover rare \nbut high cost events.\n7. Group insurance schemes \nGroup insurance is the most common form of health insurance globally. Group \ninsurance reduces adverse selection and offers the customer the advantage of collective bargaining power with respect to the features of the product, \npremium discounts etc.  \nThe critical factors to be considered while issuing a group policy are: \na) The group should be an already existing one and must not have been \nformed for the purpose of insurance coverage.", "start_char_idx": 176259, "end_char_idx": 185856, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b84a25c-177d-4b7d-a4ca-3c81ea9da1fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b84a25c-177d-4b7d-a4ca-3c81ea9da1fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b31f8c12-6164-4040-9e15-3262c108d8d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c70127d40cbef8874eee6d2ba5d5ad6d7c60b6976d485657c3d4c351b1e6838", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ea29a93-2dbf-49e2-9e12-663a147ca765", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f0c7d01354195a20259b6f7dbeaf6b5cd2ee249c37927f35ba7d13322eabd04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "141355f0-7a71-42e4-b679-ff7cea254914", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51fb96bbb0d077cc6b7de7b93d06272206b7495676bd89919b47e3d1d940ab84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "064b8c9a-8656-4c72-9329-14742744a5bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b0a04bc0da85fea728356a6ee11325f8d2e46eb2398fad01ba413f49439539f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "9c64e9f5-8ce7-4474-993b-ce911d890ce6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3337ee50bb8780d6ee71b59b7f7e4d1bf9204d1bf98d32ae9bcd0e58cf07f6fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "3383d650-f284-4d3b-ae8d-29f89c2b2305", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7e11bbb1c3d93d7d0b03b2e06d162b399a0c8cf972cade2ff6549f90b432de74", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "6498ee99-461e-4819-a27a-05d9eb397833", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e060a4621ab4596d85756ec407afe5002f9f683fffd78fb2054c471a7937a809", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "b) There should be a minimum number of members in the group (according \nto insurer\u2019s requirements)   \nc) There should be a group organiser who can act as a coordinator with the \ninsurance company.  \nGroup insurance policies can be issued to various types of groups like employer-\nemployee groups and affinity groups. Again, the premium contribution can be \neither contributory or non-contributory schemes. In contributory schemes, the beneficiaries (employees or members) also contribute to the premium and in non-contributory schemes, only the employer or the affinity organisation contributes to the premium. Normally, employee premiums are paid by the employers for availing the corporate tax benefits and it also serves as an attractive feature for recruiting the people from the market and for retaining them.\n\nCHAPTER 5  POLICY CLAUSES FOR VA RIOUS HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n94 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Example \nGroup insurance is also available to groups other than the employer-employee \ngroups but they should not be formed solely with a purpose of taking advantage of insurance coverage. For example, a credit card company can offer health insurance coverage plan to its members as an add-on benefit.  \nThe amount of coverage in such groups is decided on the basis of certain \ncriteria, which can be age, years of membership in the group or the income of the members. In case the coverage is based on the income of the members such as farmer\u2019s society or milkman\u2019s society, then it can be fixed as a fixed multiple \nof the income of each member of the group.  \n8. Difference between group and individual policies \nThere are some key differences between the group and individual policies which \nare summarised below: \na) ProductIndividual plans usually have standard terms and conditions whereas group \ninsurance policies are usually customised or tailor made and the terms and conditions can be fine-tuned according to the nature of the group. For example, the group policies may cover maternity and pre-existing diseases \nfrom day one. \nb)Premium\nThe premium for the individual products can vary from the group insurance.  \nDuring the tariff era, where premium for fire and engineering insurance was fixed by tariff, insurance companies experienced very low claims ratio in fire portfolio and used to cross-subsidise the group health insurance premium as a marketing strategy for fire business. This led to a very high claims ratio in health insurance portfolio. However, after detariffing, there has been a gradual correction in group health insurance premium. In fact, \nincreasingly the true costs of group health insurance are becoming apparent \nto corporate consumers and they are exploring ways to reduce the costs of insurance coverage for their employees/members, including cost sharing mechanisms like deductibles, introducing contribution of premium from employees to cover their dependant parents etc. \nc) Medical records\nWhen purchasing an individual health insurance policy, a person has to \nusually answer a health questionnaire and undergo lots of medical examinations. An insurance company can accept, deny or add some limitations while providing coverage on the basis of such data.  \n\nPOLICY CLAUSES FOR VA RIOUS HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  95However, most of the group health plans are provided without any medical \nexamination or records. This is because insurer is pooling the risk by covering large number of people, which helps to maintain balance between people with poor health and those with good health.  \nd) Underwriting\nIn group health insurance, every person in the group is included in the plan \nand no one can be denied coverage on the basis of any pre-existing health conditions. But in an individual health insurance plan, insurer has an option to choose or deny the coverage on the basis of pre-existing health conditions. \nTable 5.1\nDifference between individual and group health insurance \nIndividual health \ninsurance Group health insurance \nProduct terms and \nconditions  Standardised  Customised \nPremium High Low\nMedical examination Required Not required  \nUnderwriting May deny coverage to \npeople with Pre-existing health conditions  All member in group are \ncovered irrespective  \nInsurance coverage Limited (For additional \ncoverage, need to purchase separate plans) Comprehensive (For  e.g. \nPregnancy and child birth  are usually covered  \nTest Yourself 3\nWhich of the following hospitalisation costs are normally not covered under hospitalisation indemnity plans? \nI.

Common clauses in all health insurance products \nBased on the health insurance products currently available in India, some of the \ncommon insurance clauses are discussed in this Learning Outcome. Any of these clauses may be modified and/or adapted by insurance companies according to their requirements and so this section should be seen only as a general listing to help understand health insurance product conditions. However, an inquisitive student can read in detail about the various definitions and other health insurance clauses used for health insurance products on insurer\u2019s websites. \n1. 24 hours hospitalisation \nExpenses on hospitalisation are generally admissible only if the same is for a \nminimum period of 24 hours. However, there is an exception for cases of specialised treatment which can now be undertaken in a shorter time (less than 24 hours) due to technological advances called day care procedures. It usually includes hemodialysis, chemotherapy, eye surgery, D&C, angioplasty, hernia, hydrocele, surgery related to ENT etc. (this list is only indicative). \n2. Limits of usage  \na) Hospitals  where treatment under insurance cover is taken: \ni. Should be duly licensed and registered  \nii. Should be under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner, and  iii. Should have the prescribed minimum number of in-patient medical beds \ne.g. minimum 15 for Metros & larger cities, and 10 beds in smaller towns \netc.\nSuch conditions ensure that the treatment is provided at a standard and \nestablished place and scope for frauds is reduced.  \nb) Room rent : Often, to balance the costs of medical necessity and luxury, \nas also to control costs for insurers, some limits for room charges are \nimposed, say 1% of sum insured etc. \nExample \nSwati has taken a health insurance policy with a cover of Rs.1 lakh recently \nwhich has a clause for limits on usage of some hospitalisation expenses such as: \n/g57Room rent limit: 1% of the sum insured  \n/g57ICU charges: 2% of the sum insured subject to maximum of Rs.10,000 \n/g57Doctor\u2019s fees: 3% of the sum insured \n/g57Cataract operation: Rs.20,000 per eye  \n/g57Angioplasty: Rs.60,000 \n\nCOMMON CLAUSES IN ALL HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  973. Limits of indemnity \nIt is the maximum liability for any or all of the claims made during the policy \nperiod. It can be availed during the period of the policy by the insured person \nfor hospitalisation or any other claimable events. This is stated on the policy \nschedule and is also called the sum insured. \nExample \nKaran had taken a mediclaim policy for a cover of Rs.2 lakhs. Unluckily, it was a very bad year for Karan health-wise. He met with an accident and had a few fractures in his body. He had to undergo surgery for it and was later hospitalised for 15 days for recovery. The bill raised by the hospital was Rs.185,000 which was paid by his insurance company. He left with a coverage of Rs.15,000. \nFew months later, he was again hospitalised due to a heart attack and the bill \nraised by the hospital this time was Rs.25,000. As his balance indemnity limit was only Rs.15,000, the insurance company paid that amount and the balance \namount of Rs.10,000 had to be paid by Karan from his pocket. \n4. Domiciliary hospitalisation benefit \nThis benefit was previously offered in mediclaim products and now is also \nincluded in some of the newer hospitalisation policies. It implies medical treatment for a period exceeding three days for such illness which in normal course would require care and treatment at a hospital/nursing home as in-patient but actually taken whilst confined at home in India due to any of the \nfollowing circumstances: \na) The condition of the patient is such that he/she cannot be moved to the \nhospital/nursing home, or \nb) The patient cannot be moved to the hospital due to lack of any place in \nthe hospital.  \nExample \nPuneet got caught by swine flu spreading widely in his city. All the hospitals in \nthe city were mostly occupied by such patients, so he didn\u2019t get a bed in any of \nthe hospitals. His condition started deteriorating, so the doctors suggested his family to start the treatment at home by making arrangements for all the necessary set-ups of a hospital at his home. The treatment continued for six days. Puneet\u2019s health insurance coverage had a clause for coverage of domiciliary hospitalisation costs which fully covered all his expenses during this \ntreatment.\n\nCHAPTER 5  COMMON CLAUSES IN ALL HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n98 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE 5.", "start_char_idx": 185858, "end_char_idx": 195289, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ea29a93-2dbf-49e2-9e12-663a147ca765": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ea29a93-2dbf-49e2-9e12-663a147ca765", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b84a25c-177d-4b7d-a4ca-3c81ea9da1fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "80edc3d6ee0ec2dee8f987051c2fd5ab21d90b470adb9f10a518b32f76d17b26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb7d7ff0-5144-494d-8f59-53c8791d6722", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d5d9d8b75fb8fce7e04beb8bd02578f92819a0402bf79a65a94fa4dd151962ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "8d85de2f-81eb-4766-b784-59574c0e943a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c1ce561333bed494d489d5d54d90c208a7adbb2ce487641120159480b63185c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "3cf6d448-cee8-4a4c-9fc8-6f7c230ce3de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4849b83fb15f53c4b6c2b41985c7cb9d1b8bb6b3f5861273d61fc0e08f4e7914", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "7fe67b38-bd83-4713-b139-15f54a5d43b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d59d6382d2ba3558e2874ea7fa365857389f56bf1e33ad300b44123575da37e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "a6e91c54-b706-451f-b456-40b91bcf297f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9cfd23e23233cbcb3c0db2437f709cf068339b2d3a6934dcc301b84ccf47a94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "71b4be7d-eb8f-495d-811b-155a8433be60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a01d0675d10621a2b5c92f9d6a1c263a40282ccb1c9ea5c7543db9d31980e49", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Cashless hospitalisation procedure \nCashless is a facility offered to the health insurance customers through insurers\u2019 \nin-house channels or through Third Party Administrators (TPA) who coordinate \nwith the customer and the hospital to ensure that the admissible bills are not \nrequired to be paid in the hospital by the customer and are directly settled by the TPA/insurer in due course.  \nAdmission should be in a listed hospital which is in the empanelment list of the \ninsurer/TPA (network hospital) and is subject to the pre-authorisation being granted by the insurer/TPA. The TPAs will validate the incidence reported by the claimant and after satisfaction, will issue a pre-authorisation letter to the \nhospital guaranteeing the payment. The TPA may not necessarily approve all the \nclaims and may require more information or documents. Denial of cashless does not affect the admissibility of claims and the customers can submit the claim papers later to the insurer/TPA for reimbursement. \n6. Deductible\nDeductibles are a cost sharing mechanism. These are the initial amount of an \nadmissible claim which must be first borne by the insured before the insurer \nstarts paying for the claim. \nExample \nGirish has taken a health insurance policy which had a clause for deductible of Rs.10,000. This clause means that the first Rs.10,000 of every admissible claim will have to be borne by Girish and excess, if any will be paid by the insurance company. For example, if Girish has incurred hospitalisation expenses of Rs.25,000, then he will have to pay first Rs.10,000 from his own pocket as \ndeductible and then the insurance company will pay excess sum of Rs.15,000.  \n7. Co-payment or co-insurance \nIn the Indian context, both of these terms are used interchangeably to reflect \nthe percentage of risk that the insured is required to bear.  \nExample \n The health insurance policy taken by Vikas has a co-payment clause of 20%. It \nmeans that the insurance company will not bear the entire expenses. Vikas will have to pay Rs.20 from his own pocket for every Rs.100 claimed. Therefore, if Vikas will incur hospitalisation expenses of Rs.15,000, then he will have to pay 20% of it, i.e. Rs.3,000 from his own pocket and the insurance company will pay \nhis share of 80%, i.e. remaining expenses of Rs.12,000. \n\nCOMMON CLAUSES IN ALL HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  998. Waiting period \nThe initial period within which any claims made will not be entertained. \nNormally, all the new policies come with a minimum 30 days waiting period \nwherein the insured person cannot make a claim for the diseases contracted \nduring the first 30 days. This is to avoid someone taking a policy in order to get a hospitalisation claim immediately after pur chase of the policy. The waiting \nperiod does not usually apply to accidental injuries, or to renewals of policies.  \n9. Pre-existing illness \nThis gains importance in the light of the exclusion to the policy that is \napplicable for the pre-existing illnesses. This has been the subject of many legal \ninterpretations, a lot of consumer grievances and considerable media attention. In recent years, subsequent to a consensus of the General Insurance Council, insurance companies have started covering pre-existing illness after the completion of 4 policy years.  An insurance company may choose to reduce 4 year period but cannot increase the same.. \nExample \nLisa, aged 40 years is working as a financial consultant. She is a patient of high blood pressure and takes regular medication for it. She decided to purchase a \nhealth insurance policy for herself. After lots of research, she settled for a \nhealth insurance plan with a clause for an exclusion period of 12 months for his pre-existing disease of high BP. During the first year of her policy, no claims related to high BP were entertained. However, her other claims during the period which were not related to pre-existing diseases such as hospitalisation \ndue to malaria and other diagnosis tests were covered.  \n10.  Exclusions \nThe insurance company normally indicates various scenarios that cannot be \nentertained for claim payments. The rationale behind is to avoid staged or fraudulent claims, misuse insurance for profit motive and to keep costs of \nclaims low, and thus controls insurance premium costs. However, customers \nusually do not fully understand the excluded conditions and this could be a trust issue between the customer and the insurer. \n\nCHAPTER 5  COMMON CLAUSES IN ALL HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n100 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Some of the common exclusions (list is indicative and not exhaustive) are: \na) Pre-existing illness \nb) Diseases contracted during initial waiting period \nc) Expenses on treatment of specific ailments for a specific period like \nhernia, fistula, and cataract etc. (which are covered after the waiting period is over) \nd) Injury or disease due to war, wa r like operations and similar scenarios \ne) Cosmetic surgery, plastic surgery \nf) Dental treatment g) Abuse of drugs/alcohol usage \nh) Naturopathy treatment \ni) Non-medical expenses for personal comfort like television, telephone, \ntoiletry items etc. \n11. Cancellation clause Usually, this clause can only be invoked by the insurer for reasons of fraud, \nmoral hazard, misrepresentation or non-cooperation of the insured. Similarly, the customer may also cancel the policy based on the policy conditions and the \ninsurance company is supposed to refund the premium on short-term cover \nscales of the insurer. However the company is liable for any claim, which arose prior to the date of cancellation. \n12. Renewability clause After much discussion in this direction and as required by the regulator, the \nindustry\u2019s stand generally is that the health insurance products will ordinarily \nbe renewable. However, the insurer is not responsible or liable for non-renewal \nof policy due to non-receipt or delayed receipt of the renewal notice to the insured. Also, the company may revise the premium rates, terms and conditions of the policy at the time of renewal. Renewal of the policy is not automatic and the premium due must be paid by the proposer to the company before the due date. The insurer normally sends renewal notice but not sending it will not tantamount to deficiency in services. \n\nCOMMON CLAUSES IN ALL HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  10113. Standardisation initiatives \nIn a unique multi- stakeholder initiative in India, the insurance industry, \nregulator, hospitals and industry chambers (FICCI and CII), along with other \nstakeholders, have come together to undertake certain standardisation \ninitiatives for the health insurance industry, since 2007.  \nSome of these are discussed below.  \na) Standardisation of definitions There are differences in the definitions of certain terminology used in health \ninsurance and in the nomenclature and definitions of critical illnesses \nadopted by the different insurers which can create confusion in the minds of consumers and the industry. Lack of standard definitions also means that products are difficult to compare, and the availability of standard definitions thus can ensure better comparability and uniformity in the understanding of health insurance products. \nb) Standardisation of forms \nThe majority of the insurers and TPAs require mostly the same information \nin their pre-authorisation and cla ims forms. However, each of them uses \ndifferent formats and this means that a typical hospital would be expected to keep stock of 30 or 40 different forms and understand them well. If the forms would be standardised, they will be better understood, more complete and more accurate. This was therefore taken up by the multi-stakeholder working groups to develop and suggest to the industry for \nstandardisation of forms for pre-authorisation and claims which could be \nused by all insurers and TPAs.   \nc) Standardisation initiatives on the non-medical expenses \nInsurance companies providing hospitalisation indemnity covers generally \nexclude certain categories of expenses in their policy terms and conditions. However, there is no detailed listing of such excluded expenses, and the \ninterpretation of these exclusions is highly varied across different payers in \nthe industry. There are many cases when various items under the claims filed by hospital providers or individual policyholders are repudiated by the insurers but are disputed by the claimants. This is, thus, one major cause of acrimony between insurance companies & healthcare providers and also causes a lot of confusion in the minds of consumer. Hence the stakeholders from the insurance, TPA, medical providers joined together to come to a consensus on the list of non-medical expenses to evolve an exhaustive list of \nsuch items.  \n\nCHAPTER 5  COMMON CLAUSES IN ALL HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n102 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE In February 2013, IRDA has brought out \u2018Guidelines for Standardization in \nHealth Insurance\u2019 which among other thing cover above 3 items \u2013 key definitions, standard forms and list of non-payable items.  Refer Annexure at the end of book for details. \nd) Standardisation of treatment guidelines (STG) \nThe aim of these treatment guidelines are to: i.

However, \ndata is not useful unless it can be processed and turned into information that allows a business competitive advantage. Though we have various information systems to collect information, sometimes, it just results in loads of information with no direction. This is because when data is collected, it is usually presented in various forms and formats which makes it out of order. Therefore, we need a proper system to use the data to help us in decision-making, pricing of products, testing various hypotheses and identifying trends and opportunities. \nIn the arena of health insurance, thousands of claims are generated every day, \nincluding hospitals, physicians, and pharmacies.  A number of TPAs process these \nclaims and route them to the appropriate payer. Thus, the TPAs carry huge amounts of data that runs in thousands everyday but other than routing them, no other purpose is served from the data. It was in this context that IRDA constituted Insurance Information Bureau (IIB) to manage the information of the insurance industry as a central data repository. Data queries and analyses have \nbeen facilitated greatly with the help of such data warehousing and now the \ndata is used increasingly by a wide variety of employees, , hospitals, insurers and other stakeholders in the industry. \nWe will discuss various data collecting, processing and analysing techniques in \ndetail in this chapter. \nA. Data in health insurance \nWith the growing complexity of health insurance business and ever changing market scenario there is a need for scientific pricing and designing of insurance \nproducts. Data is one of the vital elements of health insurance business. Policy \ndesign, business performance monitoring, product pricing, financial reporting, asset liability management etc., are all dependent on historical data.", "start_char_idx": 214009, "end_char_idx": 223350, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a5dfea7-40a3-4348-ad5e-a1062de409f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a5dfea7-40a3-4348-ad5e-a1062de409f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3baecbc-f45c-4516-8782-6be9a9dd8c64", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b833ebfbd8ea97f2916b77bafebe63cf0d6aa8e018987cdaf67f6d65c0fbe3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e9500ee2-f216-4ad4-8670-6f28220e2e92", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04d5e4d66b74558b78080fdced37d631d7dcb22638563af78bd78d8bf1768dab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "7ec2fdd4-497c-41fb-ba08-5e22446f313f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3a8408b92fb51837d5f720ecf6e87818400cb50d015e83b258cee6c38be1fef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "3d13efce-f3d1-422b-b6ee-1922b1fb735f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c37acfb567cf4715a733fd8d7ee8c6eb5afc92216a19bae235f4373dc8a8bf0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "62464042-a397-42f1-a19d-95e87cb74836", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "681b36b92bc2534d604d80828ac5ea0bfe4ae1d033d5b3be0f5dd18b9710f80b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "ffb34350-b4a9-4587-bf44-d68aa47d4a29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f9dbd7d2deb2e6a9361b8e0a12c271d784b518ae899a55e8422438cfa9a0398", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Data is also used in different forms in various departments other than just its \nuse for actuarial purposes.

Actuaries : Perform most of the rating and underwriting analyses \nincluding experience rating, classification and segmentation analysis and \ninternal tariff development. \niii. Underwriters : Use data to study the pattern indicated by the data to \ndecide the acceptance or denial of a risk. An underwriter also uses data to load premiums or provide discounts for a particular kind of risk.\n  Example \nInsurance underwriting is the process of selection, classification and rating of \nrisks and it cannot be performed effectively without the availability of \nsufficient data.  \nUnderwriters review applications for insurance coverage submitted to the \ncompany. They collect data from various sources to investigate the factors affecting the probability of loss and to determine whether or not to accept a particular applicant. They analyse information on the policy application and collect additional data. They study medical reports and also obtain detailed \ndata about the applicant's occupation and involvement with hazardous tasks or \nother risky activities. In addition, they apply actuarial tables which give the statistical probability of loss based on actual experience of large groups of people over many years.   \nAfter deciding that an applicant is an acceptable risk, underwriters usually \ndetermine the amount of the premium. Underwriters usually need more data and detailed analysis for underwriting individual health insurance than group \nhealth insurance. \n\nCHAPTER 6  DATA IN HEALTH INSURANCE \n116 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE iv. Finance : Use data to evaluate the company\u2019s liabilities for financial \nreporting and maintaining solvency margins as stipulated by the regulator. \nv. Others : Marketing and sales department use data to benchmark the \nperformance of underwriting offices and staff members. Data is also used for provider contracting function in establishing fair yet competitive fees to pay providers.  \nb) For regulators\nUse data to analyse the overall performance of the sector, to keep track of \nmarket developments, to frame policies in regards to solvency margins, file \nand use, customer education and awareness etc. \nc) For Government  Data is used by various ministries in formulating social schemes such as \nRashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), Arogyashri which may require \ndetailed study of the historical data related to disease burden, socio-\neconomic factors, claims experience etc.  \nd) For TPAs  \nUse data to evaluate their own performance in terms of claim settlement, \nturn-around time, impact of prior-authorisation etc., as also to improve the \nbusiness intelligence of their processing systems which can help \nautomatically alert outliers. \nExample \nTPAs (Third Party Administrators) function as an intermediary between the insurer and the insured and facilitate cashless services of insurance. The TPAs process and approve the bills. \nThe TPAs use the health insurance data to develop appropriate systems and \nmanagement structures for controlling cost, develop procedures to minimise \nunnecessary treatments/investigations, improve quality of services and ultimately lead to lower insurance premiums. \n\nDATA IN HEALTH INSURANCE  CHAPTER 6 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  117Diagram 1: TPA\u2019s role in health insurance \ne) For other stakeholders\nProviders, brokers, consulting firms, industry bodies (CII, FICCI) and \ninternational bodies (WHO, World Bank) also uses data for various different purposes.\nExample \nHealthcare providers can use the health insurance database for taking initiative to deliver services to their patients in a high quality and efficient manner. They can take action to increase the patient outcomes, but at reduced cost. Providers can also use this data to identify the gaps in the service provided and \nimprove delivery and patient satisfaction. \n2. Basic health insurance data elements \nIRDA requires insurance companies / TPAs to capture and report data in a \nspecified format. It helps to ascertain that data is collected and reported in a standard format across all the insurers. Following are the tables in which data is required to be submitted to IRDA on a periodical basis: \na) Policy data (Table A) The policy level information is contained in this table. It has details such as \nthe total number of members covered under a policy, policy premium, start \ndate and end date of policy. \n\nCHAPTER 6  DATA IN HEALTH INSURANCE \n118 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE b) Member data (Table B) \nThis table contains information about the individual members covered under \nthe policy. The details include the age or date of birth of member, sum \ninsured, gender and relationship with the insured. \nc) Claims data (Table C)Information on claims made by the members covered is contained in this \ntable. The details include the date of admission and discharge, diagnosis description and code, name of the hospital, amount paid as well as claimed and the date of payment. \nd) Outstanding claims data\nThis table shows the outstanding claim amount at the beginning and close of \neach financial year as well as the total amount paid during the year in aggregate.\nThe table below shows the list of important fields which are covered in \nTables A, B and C. \nTable 6.1\nTable A Table B Table C \n1.

The insurer can develop profiles of different customers using information such as demographics, behavioural or lifestyle data, product and service utilisation, survey data and information about customer healthcare attitudes. The insurer can use this knowledge to keep its customers happy by delivering best products and care to them.  \nData warehousing can also provide information about the products and services \nmostly used by the customers. It also provides information about the specific products to be targeted to specific populations. Insurers can also use the marketing data to track the responses of the customers for a specific product so \nthat if required, it can be evaluated and refined on time.  \nTest Yourself 1\nAn underwriter uses health insurance data to _____________________________. \nI.

Collection and analysis of health insurance data \n1. Collection and collation of data in India and the IRDA data repository28\nInsurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) was set up to protect the \ninterests of the policyholders and to regulate, promote and ensure orderly growth of the insurance industry. To accomplish this objective and for the \nefficient functioning of the insurers, it is important that reliable, timely and \naccurate data is collected, processed and disseminated by an independent body. Data is important for any industry and especially for the insurance industry which is essentially data oriented. IRDA, therefore, constituted an Insurance Information Bureau (IIB) in 2009 to provide reliable data on the \nsector to researchers and policy makers. \nBefore the IIB was created by IRDA in 2009, health insurance industry sent the \ndata to the Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC) since the year 2004. Section 64 UE \nof the Insurance Act, 1938, inter-alia authorised TAC to require and collect information etc. The TAC also published a Health Insurance Data Reporting Manual which contained detailed instructions on acceptable data structures to standardise data collection. Data table formats and manual developed by TAC were revised in 2008 and were then adopted by IRDA, which later authorised IIB to perform the function of collecting, collating and disseminating data earlier vested with TAC.  \nExample \nData compilation, storage and analysis in the Indian health insurance sector got a major boost with the introduction of TPAs. The TPAs have emerged as the custodians for enrollment and claims data for their clients. They manage the policyholder details through the readily availa ble tailor-made software for such \npurposes and provide it to IIB periodically. However, the data stored by different TPAs may have significant variation in terms of quality and \nconsistency.\nBy virtue of powers vested with the IRDA to seek information and returns, under \nsection 14 (2) (h) of the IRDA Act and under sections 14, 21 and 110c of the \nInsurance Act, all insurers have been directed to submit information to the IIB in the data formats specified by IRDA within time limits fixed by IRDA. \nIIB has created a data warehouse which will enable insurers, other stake holders \nand researchers to have easy access to validated data from one source. IIB collects data from all insurers (and TPAs), integrates the data into logical subject areas, stores the data in a manner that is accessible and understandable \nto decision makers and delivers data / information to decision makers through \nreport writing and query tools. Aggregated analysis of health insurance data is also made available on the IRDA website. \n                                             \n28 Based in information from the IRDA website and reports of working groups of CII and FICCI \n\nCHAPTER 6  COLLECTION AND ANALYS IS OF HEALTH INSURANCE DATA \n122 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE IRDA will be the sole and exclusive owner of all data collected / received from \nthe insurance industry. Users will be provided with only specific levels of permissions to use the said data. IRDA also reserves the right to impose restrictions on the use of data and publication of findings from the data. \nIIB\u2019s governance is done through an advisory committee consisting of IRDA \nChairman as Chairman, Director General (R & D) as Vice Chairman, Executive Director (Administration), IRDA as Convener, three data management experts, \nSecretary Generals of life and non-life insurance councils, a representative each from the life insurance and non-life insurance business who will be engaged as members on annual rotation basis. \nDiagram 2: Data warehousing by IIB \n2. Data interpretation \nAnalysis of data can be performed on various parameters and at different levels \nof complexity. Following are few examples of analysis at the elementary level:  \na) Written premium \nPremium received by an insurer in a particular period (policy year) \nThis analysis can show the number of people covered and policy premium \nreceived by type and by written policy year for each underwriting office. This helps in identifying the average premium (on per person basis) for both group and individual policy. This will help an insurer to understand where to focus its sales and marketing efforts. This will also help to monitor the result of rate actions taken by the various underwriting offices. \n\nCOLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF HEAL TH INSURANCE DATA  CHAPTER 6 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  123Example \nAn insurance company introduces a low cost health insurance product for the \npeople staying in rural areas. The cost of the product was as low as Rs.10 per member per month in a family. As the company introduces the product for the first time and that too at a very low cost, it was concerned about the results.  \nHowever, the analysis done at the end of the year on written premiums for the \nproduct were quite surprising. The product was able to attract many people in rural areas due to its low cost which resulted in a strong policyholder base and overall profitability. The company therefore, decided to continue the product \nat the same price.  \nb) Earned premium \nThe portion of an insurance written premium which is considered \"earned\" \nby the insurer, based on the ratio of the time elapsed on the policy to its \neffective life.  \nThis analysis can divide the written premium for each of the policy years \ninto two segments: earned premium for the current year and the balance for the remaining period for which the insurance coverage will continue.  \nExample \nKetan has taken a health insurance policy in July 2012 and paid a premium of \nRs.10,000 for two years. By December 2012, six months had passed and there \nwere no claims made by Ketan during this period. So, the insurance company will have an earned premium amount of Rs.2,500 (Rs.10,000 x 6 months/24 months) for 6 months. This amount is now profit for the insurance company. \nThe calculation of earned premium has two major uses: \ni. It helps in calculating the unearned premium reserve at the end of the \naccounting period, which needs to be shown in the financial statements.  \nii. It is used to calculate the insurer\u2019s loss ratios for different products \nwhere total losses or claims for a period are divided by the earned \npremium for the corresponding period.  \nc) Age distribution \nThis is the number of people covered in different age bands for both group \nand individual policies.", "start_char_idx": 232242, "end_char_idx": 241666, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16662ef3-857f-41cf-a4da-ae05e8c87e6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "16662ef3-857f-41cf-a4da-ae05e8c87e6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9500ee2-f216-4ad4-8670-6f28220e2e92", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04d5e4d66b74558b78080fdced37d631d7dcb22638563af78bd78d8bf1768dab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14b3ce89-7963-4a30-bcb0-e0f9f1da0974", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c21da7733925e7922207a9690051d9468f1b633215b3961124d5e3e11230f862", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "dd9d6ea6-4505-47f9-9962-8e4730ab94a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "90326f8cb8eeade0a75d8c43a5b0205cedfc0dac7b5aa588b2c049e93a31e6c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "24861315-d617-4343-bd44-d7be473bfb6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3323784d0b4d393684303acb35a9e966c1e9da979b8a300a2b5e5f5434627ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "4b78c190-65a9-4e6d-8e6c-6daa3bfce230", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1230fc59c1967d68476bd642927784b6e5d566c376c55e62d4092420114fa548", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "640a32b4-aa4a-4ba7-9750-db8378d460eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37241385a916f10bc399fffbf21a6e45e30139be23b0f5787a0b6ee46bc00bd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "This analysis is used to: \ni. Study the percentage share of each of the age categories for each policy \nyear \n\nCHAPTER 6  COLLECTION AND ANALYS IS OF HEALTH INSURANCE DATA \n124 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE ii. Understand the customer profile changes from year to year in different \nage bands. \niii. Understand the demographics of covered people and therefore their risk \nprofile.\nd) Group size distribution \nGroup size is an important indicator for risk. Small groups represent riskier \nbusiness while large groups represent less risk from an underwriting perspective. This analysis can show the number of people covered and the premium for different group sizes for both group and individual policies. This analysis is used to:  \ni. Study the average premium (per person)  \nii. Study the percentage share of number of people for the corresponding \nproduct categories in proportion to the total number of people.  \niii. Illustrate premium per person for different groups  iv. Understand the change in claims cost from year to year, and  \nv. Facilitate monitoring the individual, small group and large group blocks \nof business separately.  \nExample \nAn insurance company, while providing group insurance coverage to large \ngroups, generally does not ask employees to fill out a medical questionnaire \nprior to obtaining coverage. So, the company will have to do the data analysis \nof the previous available records of the group. The data analysis related to prior history of employee participation in the group insurance plan, claims experience of the group in the past years as well as any overall increases in the cost of providing health insurance coverage can help the insurance company to set the \nannual premium rates for the group. \ne) Claims probability distribution\nThis is the distribution of the number of claims paid and the corresponding \nclaim amount paid for different amount paid ranges. Claim probability for any individual is related to the expected number of claims occurring in a given year and the cost associated with each such claim. \nThis is used to study the percentage of total claim amount paid for each \nclaim range in proportion to the total claim amount paid. The claims \nanalysis helps to calculate the expected frequency and average amount of \nclaim in different claim ranges. This can be used further to calculate the expected amount per claim.  \nThis distribution is vital to understand the probability of claims of certain \nsizes. With this knowledge the actuary can develop the expected cost of claims for policies with various sum-insured amounts. This would also form the basis of the rate calculation for sum-insured policies.  \n\nCOLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF HEAL TH INSURANCE DATA  CHAPTER 6 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  125f) Claims analysis  \nThis analysis can show the amount of claim, the total amount paid and the \namount paid for different benefits, including room, nursing, surgery, \nmiscellaneous etc. It can show the total amount of claims paid and the \ncorresponding number of claims for different years and the components of claim costs.  This analysis can be done under various categories such as: \ni. Claims analysis by sum insuredThis analysis can show the distribution of number of claims paid and the \ncorresponding claim amount paid for different ranges of sum insured. This is \nused to study the percentage of total claim amount paid for each sum \ninsured range. This analysis will help insurer to point out the utilisation level at different sum insured ranges.  \nii. Claims analysis by age bandsThis analysis studies the number of claims and the amount paid for each age \nband and hence reflects the average amount and the percentage of total \namount paid for the respective age bands. This analysis helps in identifying \nthe frequency and severity of claims from different age bands. \niii. Claims analysis by geographic locationsClaim frequency and severity can be calculated separately for each \ngeographic region. In addition an analysis by geographic location on the basis of ICD codes (discussed later in detail in this chapter) can indicate \nwhich geographic areas have a higher likelihood for a particular disease or \nhave higher healthcare costs; some loading can be appropriately done while doing premium rating when this analysis is backed by sufficient data. This analysis will help insurers pointing out the high cost location and revising its sales and rating strategies.   \niv. Claims analysis by hospitals\nComparative analysis by hospitals to illustrate the amount paid to each \nhospital on the basis of ICD diagnosis codes. This would show the average and total amount paid to each hospital for various ICD codes. This analysis will help insurers pointing out the high cost hospitals and renegotiating terms with them. \n\nCHAPTER 6  COLLECTION AND ANALYS IS OF HEALTH INSURANCE DATA \n126 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Example \nClaims analysis done on the basis of geographical locations takes into \nconsideration the topography, physical factors of the region, economic factors \ninvolved in that region, political stability, industrial development, trade \nactivities, lifestyles and other varied factors.\nThe insurance companies usually charge higher premiums from customers \nstaying in metropolitan cities than people staying in rural areas. This is because \nthe people staying in cities are more prone to health risks and accidents than \npeople staying in village areas. Moreover, the most common diseases nowadays \nlike diabetes, hypertension, obesity etc. are also more frequent in cities than in \nvillages due to lifestyle. The people staying in rural areas are more exposed to \nfresh air, food and environment, so the chances of their becoming sick are \ncomparatively less. \ng) Payment duration analysis\nThis is total number of claims settled by the end of each month from the \nmonth of claim occurrence. Hence, it reflects the percentage number of claims settled by the end of each month in proportion to the total number of claims paid up to the end of the year. \nAnalysing the claims paid with the duration of payment helps in cash flow \nplanning and identifying the settlement period of claims.  This analysis can be done on the basis of type of claims, hospitals and cities to determine the reasons for settlement delay. \nh) IBNR (Incurred but not reported) analysisReserving for the claims which are incurred but not reported at the end of \nthe accounting period \nThe IBNR data analysis can be used to:  \ni. Show the development of incremental payments by the month of \npayment\nii. Show the development of cumulative payments for each month.  \niii. Show percentage completion of payments, based on selected factors, by \nthe end of corresponding number of months for each month of claim occurrence.  \niv. Show the total claims paid to date, estimated outstanding liability and \nthe completion percentage.  \nv. Help an insurer estimate its reserves appropriately. \nvi. Estimate the full incurred claims for any time period under study. vii.Perform rating and trend analysis and every other special ad hoc analysis \nof claims expense undertaken by the insurer \nviii. Assist the insurer in filing the annual outstanding liability report with the \nregulator. \n\nCOLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF HEAL TH INSURANCE DATA  CHAPTER 6 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  127i) Analysis by diagnosis grouping and provider network analysis  \nAnalysis to show the quality and efficiency of service providers (hospitals)\ni. The claim data can be analysed by the type of diagnosis, period of stay \nin the hospital and cost of service provided by them.  \nii. This helps in identifying the major disease group, their claim frequency \nand the cost of treatment by provider.  \niii. This helps an insurer to ascertain the quality of care and appropriateness \nof the charges made by providers.  \niv. This will also help avoiding misuse, frauds and help in contracting with \nproviders.\nExample \nThe analysis of data related to healthcare providers can help insurer to detect \nfrauds by the providers. The analysis can be done on parameters such as treatment costs higher than usual, suggestive of  costlier investigations, extended duration of stay in the hospital most of the times, unrelated diagnosis and investigations etc. which can trigger the misuse of health insurance by the providers etc. The insurance company can ban such healthcare provider from \ntheir list. \n3.

ICD-10 coding system  \nThe international statistical classification of diseases and related health \nproblems (most commonly known by the abbreviation ICD) provides codes to \nclassify diseases and a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, \ncomplaints, social circumstances and external causes of injury or disease. Every health condition can be assigned to a unique category and given a code, up to six characters long. Such categories can include a set of similar diseases. \nThe international classification of diseases is published by the World Health \nOrganisation. The ICD is used world-wide for morbidity and mortality statistics, reimbursement systems and automated decision support in medicine. This \nsystem is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, \nprocessing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. The ICD is a core classification of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC). \nCountries need to adopt and implement this classification so that the morbidity \nand mortality databases are comparable within the various region/states of the country and between countries of the region/world. Such reliable information is essential for meaningful conclusion on the health status of the population and \nfor planning the development of facilities for medical and healthcare and their \nefficient functioning. \nThe ICD is revised periodically and is currently in its tenth edition. Since Indian \nindustry was still in its nascent stage in terms of data collection and analysis when the decision to implement a disease coding system was being formulated around the year 2004, the latest available version was the tenth one (abbreviated as ICD-10) and was considered as the best alternative.  \nIn India, the ICD code is generally assigned at the time of discharge either by \nthe hospital staff or more frequently, by the TPAs at the time of claim processing.  \nICDs can be used for the following purposes:  \na) For analysis of the general disease profile of population group \nb) For monitoring of the incidence and prevalence of diseases and other \nhealth problems in relation to other variables such as the characteristics and circumstances of the individuals affected \nc) For analysing medical cost and utilisation trends by location and by \nprovider\nd) For analysing impact of seasonality on disease occurrence e) For benefit pricing and negotiating costs.  \nIn addition ICD10 also provides the basis for compilation of national mortality \nand morbidity statistics by WHO member states. It is a critical input for the provider payment mechanism known as Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) where the payment to the provider is linked to the diagnosis of the ailment and not to the input of services. \n\nACTUARIAL FUNCTION IN A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY  CHAPTER 6 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  131Test Yourself 2\nThe collection of data from insurers and TPAs is currently done in India by the \n___________. \nI.

A policy holder pays premium to an insurance company and in return the insurance company promises to compensate for any unforeseen losses during the covered period. Insurance companies rely on their estimates of likely future payments for such claims to be able to be in profit at the end of the covered period. For any policy (or a set of policies), the company shall know about its profit for sure only after the covered period is over. If the premium it received fell short of the total payments it made (plus other operating expenses) then the insurance company \nwould make a loss.  \nTherefore to remain in profit, the company may take various steps: \na) Collect right amount of premium \nb) Sell the policies to only the \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018standard\u2019 risks c) Manage claims so that there are no extra claim payments \nApart from these steps, to be able to remain solvent at all times, the company \nneeds to maintain a reserve for the policies it has sold. \nAn actuarial department of a he alth insurance company will help the \ncompany in these two major tasks: \ni. Calculate the premium for each product \nii. Calculate the reserve to keep for the policies sold \n\nCHAPTER 6  ACTUARIAL FUNCTION IN A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY \n132 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Actuaries conduct various analyses to assist in the above two tasks such as: \ni. Analysis of expenses  \nii. Analysis of movement of policies such as renewal, cancellations etc \niii. Asset liability modeling \niv. Analysis for modeling customer behaviour such as fraud, renewal etc. \nActuaries, therefore, play an important role in the design of health insurance \nproducts with the help of various data analysis and morbidity tables.  \n1. Actuarial techniques \nActuarial science is a blend of four subjects: statistics, mathematics, finance \nand economics. As the actuary needs to estimate the future likely experience based on the past data, statistical techniques are frequently used for actuarial work. Economics is used to understand the impact of macro-economic factors on the assumptions used such as long term interest rate. Finance and mathematics helps in understanding the corporate governance structure and the financial securities available in the market. \nExample \nNayan purchased a life insurance policy which pays Rs 100,000 to the policy holder at the end of five years in case he is alive at that time. To calculate the premium for such a policy, an actuary will need to estimate the likely cost to the company in present value terms. Using statistics, the actuary would \nestimate the chances of survival till five years and the chances that the policy \nholder will go on paying the premiums for five years (that is, the policy is not lapsed). Using economics, the actuary will decide on the discount rate at which the future payments will be brought to the present value term (which is a \nfinancial mathematics calculation).   \n2. Fundamentals of pricing \nPricing is an exercise to determine the right level of premium so that the \ncompany makes the desired level of profit after paying for the claims and other \nexpenses on a portfolio of policies. So, an analysis needs to be done on the past data to estimate the average claim payment per policy. This analysis of claims data would be done by setting the premiums at the different segment levels such as age, sum insured, geographical area etc. The factors which may impact \nthe premium (e.g. age, sum insured, area) are called the \u2018rating factors\u2019. Ideally the premium rates can be set for all the rating factors but many times the actual premium pricing is limited to lesser factors due to market \nconsiderations and other practical issues.", "start_char_idx": 251046, "end_char_idx": 260523, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2105dc0-436e-4d31-9a25-2d54b88a399f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2105dc0-436e-4d31-9a25-2d54b88a399f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "14b3ce89-7963-4a30-bcb0-e0f9f1da0974", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c21da7733925e7922207a9690051d9468f1b633215b3961124d5e3e11230f862", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "211ff817-fb02-4cfd-b3b0-a56e99f8d737", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf4f88f0f0ccab8218a706c600bb30447cd7933cbcb889e4ef527078ff95316d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "e2442803-e37f-42a4-8a89-4a5ab14adf42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "efe955f8b4b629b75c1f65bb07b7d81b551d6f3f48101c999df181caf0f8bf75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "073260f7-127e-4f94-8673-7369f23c7a2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a84beeabac26681e6b05fde7f45e75146f2e88efdd1b0ae132d1b71ef8b533cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "305c7fd8-a135-4d69-91e5-e4d7f9328078", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a6b2c892bd54806608dfccd9984df303564021a3bca28db43406acab54adea7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "3b2b9c9b-1c40-4b81-a807-9f6ef65aa318", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee28a6bb7fd8ad03967a60a5a476bb974668049540399ba02ae0d2ecde9f5624", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "31bb490c-8029-49f0-bbdf-0afb719d5ec6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e298c39b77060790e9900a666ef8ebd7306f9ff573c3ba39f2715a369512878", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "ACTUARIAL FUNCTION IN A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY  CHAPTER 6 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  133Example \nMany factors play an important role in the pricing of an insurance product. Age \nis the most important factor among them. If an applicant is in the age group of 40 to 50 years, then the company will fix a higher pricing for their policy as this age group people are more prone to hypertension, diabetes and heart attacks.  \nSimilarly, location is also important in pricing. For example, the medical \nservices in Delhi will be more expensive than other towns or cities such as Baroda or Nagpur. Therefore, a person staying in Delhi will have to pay higher \npremiums than a person staying in small towns or cities. \nIn group insurance policies, the structure of the group also plays an important \nrole in pricing of the product. The group which employs a lot of older or experienced people will pay higher premiums than a group employing college graduates. Similarly, if the company has more of women employees and that too below the age of 35, the insurance company can price their premiums at a \nhigher rate as it may have to pay more due to maternity and childcare costs. \nThe following are the most important factors to be considered while pricing a \nhealth insurance product: \ni. The cost of paying benefits \nii. The cost of administering the program such as issuing policies, \nadjudicating claims, collecting premiums, filing annual statements, etc.  \niii. The cost of marketing and distributing policies that includes the \ncommissions paid to agents and brokers.  \niv. Companies also need to cover their cost of capital and maintain \nadequate financial reserves in case costs are higher than expected.  \nExample \nAdministrative costs incurred by an insurance company are also one of the major components to be considered in their product pricing. The administrative expenses of an insurance company comprise cost incurred in designing the product, advertisements, marketing, publicity, employee\u2019s monthly salary, \ncommission paid to TPAs and agents and other daily operating expenses. These \ncosts are also recovered from the policyholders in the form of the premium paid \nby them. \nThere may be other considerations involved in pricing apart from the technical \nanalysis such as: \ni. Comparison with the competitor pr emiums for similar products \nii. Smooth progression of premium with age, sum insured etc. \niii. Cross-subsidy (one segment may have lower profit built-in compared to \nthe other segment) \niv. Comparison of other products of the same company \nv. Premium guarantees etc. \n\nCHAPTER 6  ACTUARIAL FUNCTION IN A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY \n134 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE 3. Claim reserving \nOnce a policy is sold by the insurance company, meeting the future claim \npayments is the company\u2019s \u2018liability\u2019 until the cover is expired. This liability \nneeds to be calculated from time to time for internal management or statutory \nreporting. There are various actuarial methods used for calculating the liabilities or reserving.  \nThe claim management department sets aside a reserve for a claim the moment \nit is reported. The actual claim paid at the time of settlement may be more or less than the reserve. This claim reserving is done for each and every claim on case-by-case basis. \nActuary\u2019s role in the reserving process is to estimate the incurred but not \nreported (IBNR) claim reserves and to estimate the expected additional payments on the claims for which the claim management department has kept the reserves. Actuaries use the reporting delay pattern and the claim settlement pattern to estimate these numbers. \n4. Data and modeling \nNone of the analysis above can be done accurately unless complete and \naccurate data is captured in the company\u2019s database systems. For example to understand that which disease is causing the maximum claims for a company, it needs to capture the disease details of each claim. \nThere are two sets of data used by the actuaries:  \ni. Details of policies and the insured members, and  \nii. Details of the claims.  \nThere should also be a unique key using which each claim can be linked back to \nthe member which gave rise to the claim. \nModeling process is used to analyse the data and come up with a formula which \ncan be used to predict the future with as much accuracy as possible. These \nmodels are simplistic formulae to understand the complex real life behaviours. \nFor example using the data a model can be built which predicts the expected claim amount from a person of age 30, sum insured 200,000 in Mumbai.  \nThere are various kinds of actuarial models available which helps actuaries in \npredicting the future behaviour by analysing past claims. A strong foundation of data is, of course, the precondition to sound actuarial analysis and for setting the right pricing and reserving structures for the health insurance business. \n\nACTUARIAL FUNCTION IN A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY  CHAPTER 6 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  135Test Yourself 4\nThe actuarial department of a health insurance company helps the insurance \ncompany to ___________________. \nI.

It also provides a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances and external causes of injury or disease. \nAnswer 5\nThe correct option is I. \nThe claim management department sets aside a reserve for a claim the moment \nit is reported. This claim reserving is done for each and every claim on case-by-case basis. \nAnswer 6\nThe correct option is II.  \nAn actuary\u2019s main role in the claim reserving process is to estimate the incurred \nbut not reported (IBNR) claim reserves. \n\nCHAPTER 6  PRACTICE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS \n140 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE \n\nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  141CHAPTER 7 \nREGULATORY AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF HEALTH \nINSURANCE\nChapter Introduction \nInsurance is promise sold to the customer. In order to maintain the trust of \npeople, it is imperative that the insurer honours the promise. A variety of risks such as insurance risk, invesrment risk or liquidity risk endanger the fullfillment of this promise. Self-regulation can protect the insurer against these risks. However an independent regulatory body is needed to add an extra degree of control on the insurance business. Also the regulatory authority needs to have the adequate amount of legal backing in order to do its job to the best of ability. \nThe chapter discusses the need for health insurance regulation, the principles of \nhealth regulation and various measures taken to enforce regulation. We also look at health insurance regulation in the Indian context and the role played by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA). \nLearning Outcomes \nA. Principles and practice of health insurance regulation  \nB. Health insurance regulation in the Indian context \n\nCHAPTER 7  PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REGULATION \n142 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Look at this Scenario \nWould you buy / renew health insurance if you noticed the following things? \n/g57Renewal sometimes rejected on flimsy grounds \n/g57Claim settlement takes a long time \n/g57Premiums are hiked in an arbitary manner \nThe obvious answer would be \" NO\". That leads us to the next question.  \nHow do we prevent the above situations from happening? \nThe answer lies in regulation. Indian health insurance market is booming \ncurrently and has a lot of issues that need to be taken care of. The notion of leaving regulation to the \u201cgood sense\u201d of the companies does not always work. Robust regulations are needed to \u201cclean up\u201d the grey areas in health insurance and ensure a greater transparency. \nA. Principles and practice of health insurance regulation29\n1. Need for health insurance regulation \nAs discussed earlier in Chapter 1, the health insurance market has several \nimperfections: \n/g57Information asymmetry operating at both (insur er\u2019s and insured\u2019s) end  \n/g57Risk selection by insurers \n/g57Adverse selection of insured \n/g57Moral hazard present at the demand side (insured) or supply side (health \nproviders)\nRegulatory intervention is needed to ensure that the health insurance market is \nnot adversely affected by these market imperfections. \nA health insurance company manages the insurance risk transferred to it \nthrough the insurance contract. However this is not the only uncertainty managed by it. There are various other types of risks which a health insurer is \nrequired to manage in addition. To ensure that the insurers manage such risks \neffectively regulatory oversight is required.  \n                                             \n29 This section is based on a presentation, Regu lating Private Health Insurance, made in the Flagship \ncourse on Health Financing, May 2010, by Pablo Gottret and Somil Nagpal \n\nPRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REGULATION  CHAPTER 7 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  1432. Health insurance provider \u2013 Types of risk \na) Insurance risk \ni. Underwriting practices and risk appetite of the insurer give rise to this \ntype of risk.  \nii. In health insurance, each risk by itself is not very large but there still \nexists the risk of \u2018concentration\u2019.  \niii. Reckless underwriting can create trouble for the insurer.  iv. Reinsurance mitigates this risk, and is  discussed in more details in \nChapter 10. \nb) Investment risk \ni. The occurrence of this type of risk depends on the mix of investment \noptions chosen by the insurer, as also the overall environment in the economy.  \nii. Even if the insurer holds good quality assets, holding long term debt can \nlead to liquidity risk.  \niii. Complex investment products may be very risky (as can be seen from \nwhat happened with AIG in 2008).  \nc) Credit risk i. As in any other business with financial dealings, there is risk of default \nby business associates like providers, suppliers and reinsurers. \nd) Liquidity risk \ni. Even if the insurer is profitable, there can still be a mismatch between \nthe cash flows, and current assets and liabilities.  \nii. This mismatch reduces the insurer\u2019s ability to arrange adequate cash to \npay its liabilities at a short notice. \ne) Business environment risk \ni. The insurer may be exposed to changes in the policy environment and \nthe economic environment which may affect it adversely \nii. Operational and other risks including risk of frauds, risk of not keeping \nup with technology, risk of losing key human resources etc. \nThese risks are not discrete and often overlap and interplay. This requires the \ntop management to actively manage these risks, along with regulatory oversight.   While self-regulation has been stated as an option, the incentives to \nmanage risks are different from a regulator\u2019s perspective, thus an independent \nregulator is more effective. \n\nCHAPTER 7  PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REGULATION \n144 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE 3. Institutional failures and regulations \nInstitutional failures are, in general, caused by lax management, weak \ncorporate governance, poor central controls and supervision, unsound \naccounting systems and other infrastructure compounded by weaknesses in the \nlegal framework (IAIS, 1997). A study of 21 companies in financial trouble found that management issues were at the root of the problem (Lorent, 2008 citing Ashby, McDonnell and Sharma, 2002). Moreover, the complexity of health insurance business, the multiple risks which health insurers manage, and the market failures in the sector, all require a very effective top management role. \nWhen the regulator mandates a particular level of corporate governance, the \nlevel of regulatory involvement can decrease. Mechanisms like independent \ndirectors, actuaries, internal auditors etc. are often required (but that alone too did not work in the case of AIG). Thus, the complexity of health insurance business makes it very vulnerable to the effects of poor corporate governance. Regulation monitors and brings about timely corrective changes to reduce the risk of institutional failure. \nRegulation also serves to harmonise the activities of different players in order \nto achieve the desired social objectives from health insurance most notable of \nwhich is equitable access to health. . Health insurance is ultimately a promise, and regulation is the key to maintaining customer\u2019s confidence in the \u2018promise\u2019 of health insurance.  \n4. Why a failed health insurer has major repercussions?  \nA health insurer sells a \u2018promise\u2019 to honour a valid claim, and the consumer\u2019s \ntrust in the insurer keeping its promise is paramount.", "start_char_idx": 269891, "end_char_idx": 279176, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae7246b6-1bd5-407c-97a6-2d3ff6cbb287": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae7246b6-1bd5-407c-97a6-2d3ff6cbb287", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "211ff817-fb02-4cfd-b3b0-a56e99f8d737", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf4f88f0f0ccab8218a706c600bb30447cd7933cbcb889e4ef527078ff95316d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80f71ffc-c8ef-477b-8569-8602d8a48692", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b001aaaefec328a0d89f1a8a55961a79cd8e0b404d8f0d55c96391df09e5be42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "aa3c626a-46fc-4838-b017-c3e84fd3b900", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dcfefd5983a1f8ebb957adc5022eceb964163b4092014073799ac4956d6809f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "72732df8-126a-4ad4-8d6c-8061c547b145", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d9b33b66b315e868bcce74927559c2410108651cf69c329ec9ec6ce23eaddba4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "dfb0bec7-e792-48e4-aa13-2bc8b597f582", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "64cbc42cbd985347a2316e29f930487bdd2525d4c3e83c1f80df5397bdc964c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "744c18c0-a8d7-4eec-a420-58f779772a20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66ac6ce04c931c900f303cb1d8033e725df59301b9ad1bace5d5d202fbe662b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "5f3549cc-a9fd-4249-aaa3-58085d8797b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a5b4ea453349882ecee6dcbc2bbb3ed40eaa67886a26fec50f8065c44d5980a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "If an insurer fails, people \nwould lose their confidence in the entire health insurance system. \nAlso, in health insurance, the policyholder has long-term expectations for \ncontinued coverage. It is always more difficult to switch insurers as this may entail loss of benefits. Policyholders who are already ill and in need of ongoing medical care may lose coverage because of the insurer\u2019s failure. New insurers can decline those who present a higher risk of making claims or exclude certain \nconditions and give them poorer coverage than they already had.  \nFinally, even otherwise, health insurance coverage becomes more \ncomprehensive due to continuous renewal of insurance, completion of waiting periods related to the 1-year, 2-year and 4-year exclusions which stand covered. If a person switches insurers, he may then have to undergo these waiting periods all over again. \n\nPRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REGULATION  CHAPTER 7 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  145a) Regulatory structure \ni. Statutory base  \nThe following points are an important statutory base for the regulator. \n/g57Legal sanctity for the regulatory function  \n/g57An independent source of financing \n/g57Adequate \u2018teeth\u2019 for the regulator to take penal action  \nii. Administrative location  \nA health insurance regulator can be housed within a Health ministry or in an \nInsurance regulatory agency.  \nIn the context of a small country with limited regulatory manpower, or in \nthe case of regulator dealing with integrated insurers which also underwrite non-health businesses, having a health insurance regulator within the overall insurance regulatory structure is an option.  \nIn the case of several countries, an independent Health Insurance Agency \nlocated outside the health ministry and also outside the regulatory mechanism for non-health insurance entities is also an option. \niii. Licensing and registration These are the regulator\u2019s tools to validate the management background, \ntheir integrity, financial strength and business plans before granting the \ninsurance licence to any entity.  \nThese aspects can be important in ensuring the safety of large amounts of \npublic money which the insurers will be managing once they have a licence. \niv. Financial regulation\nRegulators usually lay down prudential accounting regulations and rules, \nfinancial reporting requirements, and undertake constant monitoring of the \nfinancial position of the insurance companies to ensure that they stay solvent and their accounting statements are true and fair. \nv. Product regulation Regulators lay down filing or approval requirements for health insurance \nproducts.\nThis includes transparency and fairness requirements to take care of the \ninformation asymmetry from the insurer\u2019s side. \n\nCHAPTER 7  PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REGULATION \n146 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE vi. Price regulation \nIn certain situations, regulator may also regulate the prices (and increases \nthereof) of health insurance products.  \nb) Enforcement of regulations\nEnsuring enforcement is the essence of health insurance regulation. All \nregulations and monitoring systems could be meaningless without enforcement. Drafting and promulgation of regulations is not enough, and enforcement is the key to achieving regulatory objectives. \nEnforcement begins with careful off-site monitoring supplemented by on-site \nvisits as necessary. Effective action for breaches or violations is the key to prevention of such breaches or violations by the same and other entities. This shows that the regulator \u2018means business\u2019. This also serves as a deterrent to similar breaches in the future.  \nRegulatory actions for breaches or violations can include: \n/g57Restricting business activity or activities by the insurer(s) \n/g57Levying fines and penalties on the insurer(s) \n/g57Ordering removal/ change of personnel \n/g57Issuing warnings to the insurer \n/g57Appointing Liquidator/ Observer/ Administrator, etc. \nc) Monitoring by the regulators \ni. Offsite monitoring\nThis is done at the regulator\u2019s office itself, without actually going to the \noffices of the insurance companies. It includes detailed examination of various documents like \n/g57MIS Reports,  \n/g57Accounts,\n/g57Reinsurance contracts,  \n/g57Outsourcing arrangements etc. \nIT systems can play a very important role in offsite monitoring as several of \nthe processes can be automated and attention of the regulator can be immediately drawn if any unexpected or adverse information flows through the system. \n\nPRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REGULATION  CHAPTER 7 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  147ii. Onsite inspections\nThese are done to verify the reports submitted by the insurers, check their \ninternal controls, and also examine the market conduct aspects of the \ninsurers. \nThese are a supplement and not a substitute of good off-site monitoring. d) Regulation for consumer protection Health insurance has several areas where regulators may need to ensure \nthat the customer\u2019s interests are protected. Some of the customer \nprotection areas for regulatory intervention include \ni. Access\nRegulators may impose requirements like guaranteed issue or variants \nthereof, for some or all products in the market. \nii. Renewability and cancellation\nRegulator may lay down certain provisions so that insurers cannot arbitrarily \ndecline renewals or cancel policies, especially where they do so with the intention of \u2018cream skimming\u2019. \nThe possible measures could include requirements for guaranteed \nrenewability or for certain disclosures on renewability to be provided upfront to the consumers to enable them to make an informed decision. \niii. Portability  across insurers, including creditable coverage from earlier \ninsurers, may also be a regulatory requirement. \niv. Product terms and conditions  may also be regulated. There may be \nrequirements like: \n/g57Standard products or minimum benefit coverage mandates \n/g57Standardisation of definitions and terms \n/g57Caps on waiting periods and cost-sharing provisions \n/g57Requirements for fairness, transparency, disclosures \nv. Prevention of miss-selling\nPrescribing the correct qualifications, background and market conduct \nrequirements for intermediaries is another area where regulators lay down \nthe requirements and help prevent miss-selling and other market conduct \nissues.\n\nCHAPTER 7  HEALTH INSURANCE REGU LATION IN THE INDIAN CONTEXT \n148 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE vi. Grievance redressal  \n/g57Often multiple channels exist for an aggrieved insurance consumer to \ntake up his grievance with, which can include \n/g57Insurer\u2019s internal review and grievance mechanism \n/g57Regulator\u2019s review and monitoring mechanisms \n/g57External reviews or Ombudsman mechanisms \n/g57Consumer law, competition laws, company laws \n/g57Contract law and judicial mechanism \nOften, regulators take the onus to co-ordinate amongst these grievance \nmechanisms, to monitor the data flowing from grievances and also intervene \nwhere necessary. Grievance redressal is important for consumer\u2019s \nconfidence in insurance. The grievance channels also serve as \u2018Eyes and Ears\u2019 of the regulator to take action towards the causes of such grievances. \nTest Yourself 1\nWhich of the following is a risk for an insurer? \nI. Insurance risk \nII. Investment risk III. Liquidity risk \nIV. All of the above \nB. Health insurance regulation in the Indian context \nEarly years of legislative controls on the insurance sector were consolidated and \nupdated as the Insurance Act of 1938, which, as revised from time to time. This does remain at the core of insurance laws for the country\n30. The regulatory \nstructure, as also the constituents of the industry, underwent several changes \nover the next 7 decades, characterized particularly by two sets of events which shaped the course of the industry \n1. Nationalisation Nationalisation of the Life Insurance industry in 1956 and the Non-life Insurance \nindustry in 1973, wherein the large number of erstwhile private insurers were \nnationalised and merged into one Life Insurance Corporation and one General \nInsurance Corporation (the latter with four subsidiary companies) owned by the Government of India. \n                                             \n30 IRDA.

Role of IRDA\nIRDA is not just a regulatory authority but also plays an active \u2018development\u2019 \nrole in health insurance, which has been established in the preamble of IRDA Act, section 14 of IRDA Act and Section 3(2AA) of Insurance Act 1938.  \nAs health insurance in India continues to be in its early stages, the role of IRDA \nis also very crucial in preventing adverse consequences of the health insurance for cost of care, equity, consumer satisfaction, fraud and ethical standards.  \nIRDA has stipulated several regulations for both life and non-life insurance \ncompanies in many aspects of business and the same are also applicable, where relevant, in case of health insurance.", "start_char_idx": 279177, "end_char_idx": 288773, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80f71ffc-c8ef-477b-8569-8602d8a48692": {"__data__": {"id_": "80f71ffc-c8ef-477b-8569-8602d8a48692", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae7246b6-1bd5-407c-97a6-2d3ff6cbb287", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2d55588a8dcb9847ef3d4f201bb0431be75164eb06f3d0d50299e227bfe2eab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1472f254-ad48-41b5-99cd-f4a9993e14d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e65c956a432159ed8e3f4d9bb0c9a92b01c86c558a90b78732369dbd9c5e7d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "4e239f87-b538-4936-8c10-4e533edbbf5d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1de7c513ff4d7bfa2393b30620cd3cb5480f32f4f01754052718eda6553fbb7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "2005678b-0f31-43e6-8cbe-1f5cd7b87462", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "06b0289c29f2054fe9363718cc7c29b239fbabdb63e38feab1c1cabd57e05b50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "bb2953b7-7a31-4b37-8f15-dee845092cdf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b8d9624cf61c146f59cfa2a0f0a17b66b3648bed91e45524128961c3f943c60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "43e6eace-21d8-4d70-8c7e-ef12c279a8df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "890c6526c899c7172a29a9c79231eaacd7ae737313de4a089f2f37fc3fc8c320", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "6da3afe9-34d9-45ec-bb40-842c01594fbf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c79ade92683bf2e1fbc74afd254a185ee7b2e4c49fabfaef935f92ef4c0a81d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Let us look at the role of the Regulator in different aspects \na) Policyholder\u2019s protection regulation and grievance redressal \nIn the General Insurance industry, the Regulator plays a vital role in the \nprotection of interests of the stakeholders, including policyholders, insurers, insurance intermediaries etc. Insurance business being a contract of Uberrima Fidei or Utmost Good Faith, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) facilitates transparency and fair business practices in the Indian Insurance industry through certain guidelines for both insurers and insured which aims to establish a healthy business environment.  \nAs part of its role as the apex body that governs the manner in which \nbusiness is conducted in the insurance industry, IRDA has formed Policyholder Protection Regulations, 2002 with a view to safeguarding the interests of policyholders at large.  \nThe Policyholder Protection regulations, 2002 comprises a set of guidelines \nfor insurers encompassing areas of point of sale, proposal form, grievance \nredressal, policy details, claims process and policy servicing.  \n\nCHAPTER 7  HEALTH INSURANCE REGU LATION IN THE INDIAN CONTEXT \n150 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE These guidelines cover the entire policy lifecycle, allowing the insured to \nmake an informed buying decision and avail of the policy benefits. The act mandates insurers to provide sufficient information to prospects regarding the aforementioned areas.  \nThe IRDA has a Grievance Redressal Cell which plays a facilitative role by \ntaking up complaints against insurers with the respective companies for speedy resolution. The IRDA however does not adjudicate on complaints. As claims/policy contracts in dispute require adjudication and the IRDA does not carry out any adjudication, insured are advised to approach the available quasi-judicial or judicial channels, i.e., the Insurance Ombudsmen, Consumer fora or the Civil courts for such complaints.  \nb) Access to health insurance for senior citizens and rural/informal \nsector workers \nIRDA act empowers it to issue regulations to the insurance company to cater \nto the needs of weaker and vulnerable section of population in specified manner.\nIRDA has laid down certain instructions for providing access to senior \ncitizens in 2009. It has also prescribed obligations under rural & social sector which encourage insurers for making products specifically for health insurance under micro insurance regulations.  \nc) Role of IRDA in standardisation initiatives IRDA has supported and actively participated in the pioneering initiatives \nthrough multi-stakeholder industry group, which worked together in \naddressing issues which concern health insurance. This has been discussed in an earlier chapter. In brief, these included Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) for 21 common causes of hospitalisat ion, standard definitions of \ncritical illness enhancing the customer\u2019s understanding of these terms and easier comparison of product offerings in  the market, standardising the list \nof non-medical expenses smoothening  the interaction between the patients, hospitals, TPAs, and insurers by minimizing ambiguities on what is \npayable under health insurance policies, standardization of important \ndocuments in health insurance system, like pre-authorization form and the claim form etc. \nThe initiatives have culminated in guidelines on \u201cStandardization in Health \nInsurance\u201d issued in Feb 2013 by IRDA.  Refer Annexure at the end of study material for detailed guidelines.   \nThese would help boost operational efficiency in the system as also yield \ndata for industry\u2019s development. \n\nHEALTH INSURANCE REGULATION IN THE INDIAN CONTEXT  CHAPTER 7 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  151d) Pre Existing diseases (PEDs) \nIt is estimated that an overwhelming majority of claim disputes in non- life \nsector are related to medical (health) insurance and majority of these \npertains to pre-existing diseases. This prompted the General Insurance \nCouncil to arrive at a standard definition for PEDs in 2008. \nDefinition \nFor all the medical expenses (indemnity) products\nPre exiting diseases will be \u201cAny condition, ailment or injury or related \nconditions(s) for which insured had signs or symptoms, and/or were diagnosed, and/ or received medical advice/ treatment, within 48 months prior to insured\u2019s first policy with the insurer.\u201d  \nPED exclusion wordings\n\u201cBenefits will not be available for any condition(s) as defined in the policy, until \n48 months of continuous coverage have elapsed, since inception of the first policy with any insurer.\u201d \nThe essence of this definition is that it provides a maximum look back period \nof 48 months and a maximum waiting period of covering pre-existing diseases as 48 months. Insurance companies are at liberty to reduce these periods but not enhance it. \ne) Renewability of health insurance policies  \nRegulator in consultation with the industry came up with landmark circulars \non renewability of health insurance policies which has many provisions and lay emphasis on adequate disclosu res, and promoting transparency and fair \ntreatment for policyholders.

They could be \nsubject to competitive market pressures, especially when the products are \ncomplex.\nThe crux of the problem from the consumer protection point of view is the \ninformation asymmetry and the imbalance of the power, information and resources between policyholders and insurers.", "start_char_idx": 288776, "end_char_idx": 298440, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1472f254-ad48-41b5-99cd-f4a9993e14d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1472f254-ad48-41b5-99cd-f4a9993e14d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "80f71ffc-c8ef-477b-8569-8602d8a48692", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b001aaaefec328a0d89f1a8a55961a79cd8e0b404d8f0d55c96391df09e5be42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7749019c-2710-486f-87f5-0e558b9ba487", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "18e79352510e58d8b427df0726653822289e8eeabd7144dcb9137b63abc33e5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "cf990c6f-df5c-4bb0-af35-d5a381b6bab5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e43681b04e6d4d3233d106f205029822fbebbe2c782ae9e9357572f991259a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "624500b3-81a6-4935-b996-d07949f5e856", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6614558398cdf1f7e766427865de828236e5644c6620bfe75b303456f98c99c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "4573dd4b-1b92-4506-aaf3-0e65e44ae6b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7fe75b3ffc0ca0c6cfbad0cbf6a0833dee9504d5daf56e833468bcfdeadb9681", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "fd046661-3662-44f5-9055-d1c54f76f05b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a209bb64d4dd7f00b17d8a30a61f64f7abe7a97d5c1e3e49efebc48cfc30c30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "1f2ef5ce-2364-4eef-9226-a2b149cfb5f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "98a07a3b47d91f20a6f9117a55dcd10793b28feba181f01cb2f444ef2b7d59ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Prospects and policyholders could be at a disadvantage, though theoretically \n(and sometimes in practice), the information asymmetry may work the other \nway around as well.  \nHowever, more often than not, insurance being a legal contract with detailed \nterms; it is the policyholder who is vulnerable to lack of awareness about policy conditions. \nConsumer protection or policyholder\u2019s protection can be achieved if certain \nbasic parameters are followed: \n1. TransparencyThe policy sale represents the start of the insurance contract. The clarity of \ninformation at the time of the sale process is important to avoid dissonance later, at the time of claims. Customers need to have transparency of information at every stage of the policy lifecycle.  \nAll the touch points like website, emails, letter, branch, call centre should be \ninformation-driven clearly informing the customer what he or she needs to know. \n2. Customer centric serviceCustomer centric services hinges around delivering on the promise undertaken \nby the insurance companies to deliver their commitment towards quality \nservice. Service processes must be designed by stepping into the shoes of the customer.\nInsurance being a matter of solicitation just does not restrict only to pre-sale \nservices but extends to the post-sales services and renewal as well. \n\nCONSUMER PROTECTION  CHAPTER 8 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  1573. Ability to settle genuine claims promptly\nIt is mainly at the time of claims where policy terms and conditions come into \nplay. If the same is explained to the customer, then the claim process becomes \nsmooth and hassle free with minimal dissonance.  \nThe claim settlement process of an insurer portrays the ability to put in place a \nrobust claim assessment process, which ensures that genuine claims are cleared speedily and fraudulent claims are identified and blocked, with steps taken to minimise their recurrence. \n4. Consumer education\nConsumer protection and consumer education complement each other. \nConsumer education not only helps the individual understand the product and risks involved better, but is also a necessity to understand market efficiency. \n5. Robust technology\nTechnology plays a major role in making the process easy, quick and \nfrictionless.\nA robust system should allow the complete tracking of all details and status \nupdates, via SMS and Email to keep the customer abreast of the progress of their requests.  \nRegardless of the channel from which the policy may have been purchased, \ncompanies are now offering their customers 24x7 access via a single toll free number, providing the confidence to the insured that the insurer is just a call away.\nA customer may contact the company through any of the following modes: \nDiagram 1: Modes of contact \n\n\nCHAPTER 8  CONSUMER PROTECTION \n158 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE The request received from the customer with respect to health insurance may \nbe related to cancellations, policy related, endorsement related, product clarification, claims status etc. \nThese requests can either be quick fixes i.e. resolved at the touch-point itself, \nusually termed as a First Call Resolution (FCR), or be assigned to the various \nresolution teams who process these cases and update the status against the service requests raised in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application. The resolution is updated to the customers via SMS, e-mails or letters.\nTo ensure customer delight and faster servicing, insurers should strive to resolve \nmost of the service requests on the first call itself. For this, the core CRM \napplication needs to be integrated with other base systems so that there is more information availability at the front-end with empowerment to close the request as an FCR.  \nIVR-CTI is another technology that is being looked into, which essentially means \nintegration of the insurer\u2019s CRM system with the incoming customer call.  \nSeveral servicing opportunities open up once this technology is implemented, as \ncustomers would be recognised from the call itself and all customer information is readily available in an instant to the front-end user.  \nCall recording solutions are now omnipresent to enable recording of all phone \nconversations at the call centre, which can be easily retrieved to protect the policy holder in case of a dispute.  \nEfficient CRMs thus facilitate and compliment efficient customer support. \nMaintenance of and access to customer records is made quick and easy thereby facilitating better customer service. A robust technology platform also enables accurate MIS and reporting.  \n6. Fair treatment\nFair treatment at every stage, both before and after sales makes insurance \nattractive to the customer and keeps his confidence in the same. Health\nInsurance being the most varied product based on requirement, need, lifestyle and standard of living, pricing plays a major role.  \nWith clear and unambiguous terms and conditions, price should be adequate, \nneither too high making it unattractive for the customer, nor too low thereby endangering the insurer\u2019s solvency. Insurers must aim to deliver a structured and fair basis for determining health benefits and pay outs.  \n\nCONSUMER PROTECTION  CHAPTER 8 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  1597. Health Data Repository\nIn the health insurance industry, asymmetric information \u2013 a situation involving \na transaction where one party has more information than the other \u2013 leads to \nadverse selection wherein individuals with high healthcare costs are more likely \nto buy insurance.  \nThe unavailability of reliable information undermines the underwriting \ncapabilities of the insurance companies, leading to increased insurance costs. Hence, it is essential to build a dependable source of information at the industry level with respect to claims, medical treatment costs and health cases, which can be leveraged by insurers to ensure that the cover is rightly priced and \ninsurance costs are under control.  \nIndustry data on health insurance claims is now available on the IRDA and IIB \n(Insurance Information Bureau) website. A common health data repository supported by standardised formats of capture of health data is a critical initiative for the industry that will help provide right priced insurance solutions to customers.  \nTest Yourself 1\nIdentify a critical initiative for the industry that will help provide right priced \ninsurance solutions to customers. \nI.

Common health data repository \n\nCHAPTER 8  CLAIM SERVICING \n160 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE B. Claim servicing \nAn insurance policy promises to pay a \u2018claim\u2019 when the insured event occurs as \nper the terms of the policy.   \nDefinition \nA \u2018claim\u2019 also refers to the documents and process by which the insured \ndemands the admissible insured amount from the insurance company. \nAn insurance company: \na) Either makes a direct payment to the hospital (cashless facility) and \nreimburses the expenses associated with the illness to the policyholder  \nb) Or disburses a fixed benefit on occurrence of an illness depending on the \nproduct \nDefinition \nCashless hospitalisation is a service provided by an insurer wherein the insured is not required to settle the hospitalisation expenses at the time of discharge \nfrom hospital, to the extent covered by policy \nThe settlement is done directly by the insurance company. However, prior \napproval is required before the patient is admitted into the hospital.   \nAn insurance company settles the claim through its own claim processing \ndepartment (\u2018in-house\u2019) or ties up with a Third Party Administrator (TPA) which undertakes to do this on behalf of the insurance company.  \nDefinition \nA hospital, which has an agreement with a TPA/Insurer for providing cashless \ntreatment, is referred to as a 'Network Hospital'.  \nTip\nCashless facility is provided only at the network hospitals.  \nDefinition \nNon-network hospitals are those which do not have tie-up with TPA  and any \npolicyholder seeking treatment in these hospitals would have to pay for the \ntreatment and later claim as per the reimbursement procedure.  \n\nCLAIM SERVICING  CHAPTER 8 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  161Diagram 2: Types of cashless claims \nCashless claims can be of two types: planned and emergency. \nThe procedure for making a claim varies with each company and/or the product \nor policy terms, but keeping a few general points in mind ensures a speedy claim settlement and prevents rejection of the claim.  \nThe claim settlement paid by the Insurance Company comprises only the \nexpenses admissible and actually incurred.  \nOn the other hand, in case of benefit policies like hospital daily cash and \ncritical illness policies, the insured is paid the pre-specified lump sum amount regardless of the actual expenses incurred. \nClaims that are not admissible, fully or partially, as per the policy conditions, \ncan be repudiated / rejected by the insurers. It is important to know that partial reductions in claimed amount are usually due to deficiency of supporting \ndocuments or for expenses, which are not covered under the policy. In case of \nthe former, if the requisite documents are made available, the claim may be considered.\nRepudiation can be prevented by carefully reading the policy for its scope of \ncoverage, co-payments and sub-limits applicable and the exclusions, and by ensuring that the insured has correctly declared the health status including any pre-existing diseases at the time of proposal for the insurance policy.  \nIt also helps in the relationship if the repudiation letter from the insurer clearly \nprovides the reasons and rationale for a deduction in the claimed amount. In cases where the insured is not satisfied by the reasons for rejection, he/she can represent the same to the insurer.  \nGrievances not resolved by the insurers within one month can also be taken up \nwith the Insurance Ombudsman within whose jurisdiction the policy is issued. \n\nCHAPTER 8  GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL \n162 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Test Yourself 2\nWhich of the following is incorrect with regards to cashless facility in health \ninsurance?", "start_char_idx": 298443, "end_char_idx": 308650, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7749019c-2710-486f-87f5-0e558b9ba487": {"__data__": {"id_": "7749019c-2710-486f-87f5-0e558b9ba487", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1472f254-ad48-41b5-99cd-f4a9993e14d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e65c956a432159ed8e3f4d9bb0c9a92b01c86c558a90b78732369dbd9c5e7d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0cca5ef0-a785-4914-98f7-b4aedd344ac9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "03b7f19e5da18ab31f6bf1ddb20de494fe50eee7f2a1229c61315c1099247acf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "3bb7c4a5-3bac-47c2-9ac0-b92dcbd63678", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "712098cdc6089f4e4f47fa2c9b6edab76120a01088d2f9bf5b42dc73ff5ca65b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "621b4606-baf6-493a-84fc-8f017dbb84cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "debb2fe9417ba3e67907310f3f2d4b18ad3e2e5674df82567b62b6267a4b4e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "bc6eb49f-6b5b-4d04-b8cb-168a7ed1d8d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d428d27cc3daa0590414c067a9e567560fc7fa7acd94f54fca3f18bff107da8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "9fbb85d8-36cc-4e8c-8533-393092b5eda4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "19e41daade423053b0bca5ff08802ccae2806e6c2e807a070112a825467e9884", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "I.

Grievance redressal \nPolicyholders must be provided with inexpensive and speedy mechanism for complaints disposal. Policyholders may have complaints against insurers in respect of either their policies or their claims.  \nAs per Regulation 5 of IRDA Protection of Policyholders Interests regulations, \n2002, every insurer should have in place a grievance redressal system to address the complaints of the policyholders.  \nOver and above this, one may approach the Insurance Ombudsman for \ncomplaints relating to personal insurance claims for value of up to Rs. 20 lakhs.  \nThe other channels available to a policyholder are the Consumer Courts and the \nCivil Courts. The IRDA has a Grievance Redressal Cell, which plays a facilitative role by taking up complaints against insurers with the respective companies for a speedy resolution.  \nWhen a policyholder has a complaint to make, he/ she must first approach the \nGrievance or Consumer Complaints cell of the insurer. In the event of there being no response or no satisfactory response, the policyholder may write to the Grievance Redressal Cell of the IRDA, which will then take up the matter with the concerned company for examination or re-examination. Only cases of delay or non-response regarding matters relating to  policies and claims are taken up \nby the Cell with the insurers for a speedy disposal. \nIf the complainant is looking for adjudication in respect of claims, he/ she may \napproach the Insurance Ombudsman. The office of the Ombudsman was set up under the Redressal of Public Grievances Rules, 1998 framed by the Central Government.  \n\nGRIEVANCE REDRESSAL  CHAPTER 8 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  163The rules apply to all the insurance companies operating in the general \ninsurance and life insurance sectors. The objects of the rules are to resolve all complaints relating to settlement of claim on the part of insurance companies in a cost-effective, efficient and impartial manner. The rules stipulate that there \nshall be a governing body of the Insurance Council, which shall consist of one \nrepresentative from each of the Insurance companies.  \nThe governing body shall appoint Ombudsmen  for the purpose of these rules. \nAny person who has a grievance against an insurer, may himself or through his legal heirs make a complaint in writing to the Ombudsman within whose jurisdiction the branch or office of the insurer complained against is located.  \nThe Ombudsman may either make a recommendation through mediation or pass \nan award, which he/she thinks is fair as per the facts and circumstances of a claim.\n1.

These best practices have been circulated amongst the insurance companies for their reference and for rating in terms of \nimportance. The best practice questionnaire was sent to all the General \nInsurance and standalone Health Insurance companies, of which 40% responded.  \nSome of the results are given below.  \n/g57Customer Protection during the Sales Process:  \n/g57Relative performance of the different dimensions: \nWhile most of the dimensions have received scores within a narrow band, an \nadequate training facility for agents is seen to have the highest importance followed by the use of technology for efficiencies in distribution of health insurance.  \n\nGRIEVANCE REDRESSAL  CHAPTER 8 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  165Diagram 4: Chart-1\na) Reduction of post sales dissonance of health insurance\nClarity of information  The highest rating was for a product brochure showing coverage and \nexclusions (which has also been recently mandated by IRDA in 2009, as a \nCustomer Information Sheet).  \nDetails on company website were the second most common measure taken \nby companies, again now required by the IRDA.   \nAnother measure was a welcome call, explaining the details to the \nconsumer.\nDiagram 5: Chart-2\n\n\nCHAPTER 8  GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL \n166 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE b) Reduction of post sales dissonance of health insurance\nCustomer feedback    \nThe various ratings in the survey indicate that the commonest mechanisms \nfor feedback include the grievance system and the audit of service delivery against agreed TATs.  \nRegular satisfaction surveys, assessment of hospitals and industry \nbenchmarking followed closely. \nDiagram 6: Chart-3\n3.

Frauds\nFrauds are present in any sector whether it is financial or non-financial industry.  \nPeople often hear about various types and forms of frauds in different industries/walks of life.  \nWhen it comes to insurance, the fraudsters think very differently and identify \nvarious loop holes in order to get a fraudulent claim.  \nA very famous and humorous incident that happened long ago will help the \nstudents to understand the gravity of insurance fraud and how a fraudster cannot go scot free for long.  \nExample\nOnce a person purchased a box of rare and expensive cigars and got fire \ninsurance cover for his cigars.  \nThe insurance company also understood the importance of the rarity of the \nbranded cigar and insured it with utmost good faith.  \nThe customer smoked the entire cigars within a month and claimed to the \ninsurer that the cigars were lost in a series of small fires (which indirectly \nmeans that he smoked).  \nThe insurance company refused to pay stating that cigar consumption will not \nqualify for the claim.  \nA case was filed before the court and court ruled in favour of the customer \nstating that the insurance company did not define in its policy as \u201cwhat is \nconsidered to be unacceptable fire and acceptable fire\u201d and hence, ordered the \ncompany to honour the claim (this shows the importance of policy wordings and conditions).  \nThe insurance company honoured the claim as directed by the court.  However, after the customer cashed the cheque, the insurance company had \nhim arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony \nfrom the previous case being used against him, the customer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in \njail and a $24,000 fine. \nDefinition \nHealth insurance fraud is described as an intentional act of deceiving, \nconcealing, or misrepresenting information that results in healthcare benefits \nbeing paid illegitimately to an individual or group.  \n\nPERCEPTION CUM CAUSES AND E FFECTS OF FRAUDS  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  175The main purpose of fraud is financial gain. However, it not only creates a hole \nin the insurance companies' pocket, but affects all the stakeholders.  \nIt not only invites higher premiums, but also leads to restricted benefits, higher \ninsurance co-payments; potential of denial for future coverage, higher service \ntaxes and also impacts the quality of care. \nTip\nVarious estimates indicate that fraudulent claims in the industry could be \nanywhere up to 15 - 20 per cent of total claims.  \nHealth insurance has even otherwise been a bleeding sector with very high \nclaims ratio. So, to make health insurance viable, there is a need to focus on eliminating or reducing fraudulent claims.  \nTest Yourself 1\nWhat is the main purpose of fraud? \nI. Financial gain \nII. Lowering premiums III. Reducing claims IV. Lowering taxes \nB. Perception cum causes and effects of frauds \nIt is unfortunate that unlike frauds committed in other industries, insurance frauds are always seen in the lighter sense by various stakeholders.  \nThe usual penalty the person gets is the repudiation of the claim in majority of \nthe instances and this gives the strength to the fraudster to try his hand on various Insurance frauds.  \nWhether claim money is paid or not, fraud impacts the insurance industry in \nmultiple ways:  \n/g57If the claim is paid, then it affects the claim ratio and actuarial pricing \nwhich in turn affects the reinsurance ratings and triggering more stringent underwriting norms that may cause aversion among the genuine public to take policies with the company.  \n/g57If the claim is not paid,, it has multiple effects due to   spread of  news \nabout  higher repudiations which in turn may affect business and also the faith in the industry.  \n\nCHAPTER 9  PERCEPTION CUM CA USES AND EFFECTS OF FRAUDS \n176 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE The below diagram highlights a picture of the fraud \nDiagram 1:Impact of fraud  \nHence, the best part will be to nib the frauds in the budding stage itself so that \nthe business itself is not underwritten.  \n1. Classification of frauds \nFraud claims are wide-ranging, from misrepresented services, services not \nrendered and services rendered to 'rented' patients, to a broad spectrum of revenue-enhancement mechanisms.\nFrauds are commonly classified as follows: \na) Internal and external \ni. Internal frauds\nInternal frauds are those perpetrated against an insurance company or its \npolicyholders by agents, managers, executives, or other employees.  \n\nPERCEPTION CUM CAUSES AND E FFECTS OF FRAUDS  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  177ii. External fraud\nExternal fraud schemes are directed against a company by individuals or \nentities as diverse as medical service providers, policyholders, beneficiaries, \nmedical consumable vendors etc.  \nb) Hard and soft \ni. Hard fraud\nHard fraud is a deliberate attempt either to stage an event or an accident, \nwhich requires hospitalisation or other type of loss that would be covered \nunder a medical insurance policy.  \nii. Soft fraud\nSoft fraud, which is sometimes called opportunity fraud , occurs when a \npolicyholder or claimant exaggerates a legitimate claim. Soft fraud may also occur when people purposely provide false information with regard to the pre-existing illness or other relevant information to influence the \nunderwriting process in the favour of the applicant.  \nc) Provider and consumer\nFraud can be committed both by the insured member or the provider and at \ntimes are a concerted effort of agents, brokers, insurance employees, insured member and the provider of services and other stakeholders of the healthcare system. \nTest Yourself 2\nWhich of the following fraud is also called as opportunity fraud? \nI. Internal fraud \nII. External fraud \nIII. Hard fraud IV. Soft fraud \n\nCHAPTER 9  HEALTH INSURANCE FRAUDS  VS. GENERAL INSURANCE FRAUDS \n178 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE C. Health insurance frauds vs. General insurance frauds  \nMotor and health insurance are very prone to insurance related frauds. \nDocuments such as fake medical bills and certificates are commonly used to defraud insurance companies in the country. These are followed by driving license and FIR related papers.  \nThere is a perception among customers that the insurance company pays less \nthan what you claim even if it is true loss assessment, which often motivates them to exaggerate their claims. \nIn Health Insurance frauds, it often requires cooperation from multiple \nstakeholders to organise a fraud. Though it may sound little difficult to get buy-in from other stakeholders like Hospitals, but once it is obtained, it becomes very easy job to lodge fraudulent claims.  \nThese days various multi-dimensional analyses are enabled by the insurance \ncompanies so that any fraudulent pattern is identified within the least possible \ntime. This enables to control the claims leakage in the shortest possible time.   \nBased on the pattern analysis, many triggers are set to ensure that fraudulent claims are not paid. Some of the triggers are given below. \n1.Triggers to detect fraud claims (only indicative but not exhaustive) \nInsurance frauds usually have common profile and pattern. There are certain \nparameters which can be used as a trigger to detect or analyse fraudulent \nclaims or practices. They are as follows: \na) Treatment costs are usually on the higher side as compared to the \netiology.\nb) Costlier investigations carried out without justification.  \nc) Diagnosis of the ailment and the investigations done are not much \nrelated to each other.  \nd) Duration of stay in the hospital is more than expected.  \ne) Post-operative histopathology reports are not available (surgical cases).  \nf) Documentations are usually in perfect order.  \ng) Higher number of re-imbursement claims from certain providers. \nh) A pattern where the treating doctor, agents, ailments are the same in \nmany claims. \ni) Medicine bills in serial order. \nj) Patient residence and the hospital, chemist address, are not in same \ngeographical location  \nk) Short term policy holders with lower sum insured. \nl) Higher per-patient cost in a hospital.  \nm) Excessive patients\u2019 per-doctor in a hospital.", "start_char_idx": 326720, "end_char_idx": 336135, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90097b64-5b3b-4a63-8302-c40398ca459c": {"__data__": {"id_": "90097b64-5b3b-4a63-8302-c40398ca459c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfb1e35d-a847-4855-af7b-70e601581fc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b254bbd557c5970326d998ad2c2316f99b87ed4c69ea2d6e8dd91d54c3a7f933", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ffdab8b-600a-40e4-a3c3-2bb5252ead48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be775f7788efe1ff170ce7c33767619a47c42a78352630f3eedb9f12092e890d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "f5e6ddcf-a117-436a-83c0-a3e6dbc92b75", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "92d36672088aa0d8af35250df984c630f68821663ccd051ab95dc282c3af9c54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "dd4c8369-0a93-453f-825d-2bade09965a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "86dcb814bce62c29aa08649913560bf4d3a5ec6c94f69cb9a11e72109c4ac678", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "1355e1b3-286d-429e-b11c-4d4f2c2f4bee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d030699bec92e3045838deb64472d4e1547ccd7213ce505ee01efa9ee8146ad6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "b23a2349-d59c-4606-8c42-907b85164b11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "83f414b6d1e9f8758727b3f6dd9abf1f0552d00f4c5fb0939d7441ec9e3e1e72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "5a00a359-4097-4638-83d7-e96edc3e10b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0b8fae892d2a6b6b73cf64590847a21d384a332abdd069e9a1d365017b6b7eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "m) Excessive patients\u2019 per-doctor in a hospital.  \nn) Higher per-patient average visit numbers. \no) Higher per-patient average medical tests.  \n\nCONSUMER FRAUDS  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  179Test Yourself 3\nWhich of the following parameters can be used by insurance companies as a \ntrigger to detect fraudulent claims? \nI. Costlier investigations \nII. Lower per patient average medical tests \nIII. Medical bills in serial order \nIV. Availability of post-operative histopathology reports \nD. Consumer frauds  \n1. Categories of consumer frauds \nConsumer frauds mainly fall in three categories. \nDiagram 2:Categories of consumer frauds \na) Claims fraud\nConsumer claim fraud occurs when a consumer makes an intentional \nmisrepresentation in order to receive a benefit payment he is not entitled to for such claims can be further categorised as:  \ni. False claims:  For instance, maternity claims which are not covered \nunder the policy benefit and member is making a claim of hysterectomy \nwith fabricated medical papers. \nii. Collusion with providers:  Both provider and the member collude to \nsubmit a false claim where the physician receives benefits from the false claims.\niii. Insurance speculation:  An insured applies for several health insurance \npolicies without revealing his/her other insurance coverage. Insured \nmakes a claim from all insurance companies.  \niv. Fraud rings:  A group involving consumers, agents, physicians, provider, \nmaking series of  false claims \n\nCHAPTER 9  CONSUMER FRAUDS \n180 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE b) Application fraud\nThis is committed when material misrepresentations are made on an \napplication for insurance with the intent to defraud.  \nApplication fraud differs from claim fraud in that the perpetrator is not \nseeking to illegitimately obtain a benefit payment-rather the perpetrator is seeking to illegitimately obtain health insurance coverage itself.  \nHere, an applicant denies serious medical condition at the time of taking the \npolicy to obtain coverage that might have been denied or excluded from the scope of coverage or to avoid additi onal loading of premium.  \nAnother case is when the consumer is having pre-existing disease, but does \nnot declare at the time of filing a claim. Also, in the case of corporate, changing the joining date of the employee and getting an endorsement passed by the insurance company with falsified records is an application fraud.\nc) Eligibility fraud\nIn such cases, the benefit is paid illegitimately because the beneficiary was \nnot truly eligible to receive benefits because of non-disclosure from the insured. Eligibility fraud most commonly involves misrepresentations of the status of a dependent or of someone's employment status.  \nExample \nFor instance, a member submitting claim of his siblings or relatives or dependants, which are not covered under the policy or, a business's group \nhealth plan covers all full-time employees but not part-time workers.  \nA part-time employee colludes with another employee in human services to \nfalsify records so that it appears that he works full-time and is covered by the plan. \n2. \u2018Staging claims\u2019 frauds \nDefinition \nStaging of fraudulent claims is a long cycle wherein even the person will not \neven be existing by a specific name at the specific address.  \nHowever, relevant records are created and the policies will be issued. After a \nwaiting period, claims will be lodged by producing fake claim documents. In \nsummary, all the documents will be fake and fabricated to prove that the entire \nchain of claimed events is genuine.  \n\nCONSUMER FRAUDS  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  181However, Insurance companies have come up with various tools like \nUnderwriting Score Cards  (which will rate the person based on the profile, \nfinancial strength etc.) and also order for profile check through field study wherein such persons are caught within short  period of lodging such claims. \nApart from this, there can be frauds that are committed during each stage of \nfraud cycle viz.  \na)Proposal to policy stage  \nb)Frauds during Contractual period and so on.  \nThough the intent of such frauds may not be to the extent of \u2018Staging claims\u2019 as \nthe objectives of such frauds are different. Nevertheless, it still needs strong \nvigil on the part of insurance company.   \n3. Stages of insurance fraud(s) Insurance Frauds can be occurring into 3 broad stages during the policy \nlifecycle:\nDiagram 3:Stages of insurance fraud \n\n\nCHAPTER 9  CONSUMER FRAUDS \n182 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE a) Fraud possibilities at proposal and policy Stage \nFraud is said to be conceptualized and initiated from the time the person \ndecides to take a policy and signs the application form for insurance. Here \nthe fraud or misrepresentation can be in one or many of the following \nactivities;\ni. Disclosure of material information in the proposal form\nInsurance contract is a contract of utmost good faith where it is obligation \non both parties to provide all information which is material to the contract. It is therefore imperative that disclosure(s) of all material facts is made to \nthe Insurer.  \nHow a question is worded determines a lot as to how information will be \ngiven. If you do not ask a specific question, you cannot expect a specific answer.  \nii. Disclosure of material information at the medical stage:\nNormally Insurer seeks additional information about the insured\u2019s health by \nmedical examination (with regular or specializ ed tests) which is done basis \nthe sum assured or age or if there is any adversity noted in the application form.\nThe medical information collected through the empanelled diagnostic \ncentres helps the insurer in identifying any adversity/abnormality or accurately estimates the prognosis of the ailment thereby helping in pricing \nthe risk appropriately.  \nThe following disclosures have to be appropriately studied so as to weed out \nfraud:\n/g57Disclosure of health status to the medical examiner \nIf the individual is suffering from hypertension or diabetes unless the \napplicant discloses there is no way the medical examiner would know \nabout the same with mere simple medical examination.  \nEven further, if the person is on treatment with certain drugs, the lab \nfindings could still be in normal range and policy could be issued at normal rates as there is no disclosure about these ailments. These frauds potentially penalize the genuine policyholders.    \n\nCONSUMER FRAUDS  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  183/g57Impersonation\nTo avoid this issue, insurers insist the applicants to carry a valid and \nauthentic photo ID proof which is checked by the empanelled centre \nbefore examination is done. This ensures that the examination is done of \nthe same person who has applied for insurance.  \nAdditionally, sometimes proposals are introduced on fictitious names. \nThere are also instances of low premium policies being written on the lives of servants and other known persons a close monitoring is needed to detect such acts and severe penalties should   be imposed when such acts are detected. \n/g57Manipulation of tests/records\nIn addition to the manipulation done by agent or customer, even the \nmedical doctors could be a party to insurance fraud and provide manipulated test results so as to suit the insured\u2019s requirement and provide policy at favourable terms. \niii. Cash defalcation\nAnother fraud which is most widespread both at the proposal submission and \nat renewal premium payment stage is cash defalcation.  \nThough there are several measures being taken to restrict cash transactions \nhowever no company has been able to arrest this problem completely unless the decision to stop cash acceptance as a mode of premium payment is \ntaken.\nb) Frauds during the contractual period  During the policy lifecycle there may be several transactions carried out by \nthe insured which could be: \ni. Address and contact details change\nHere care should be taken if the contact details including the address of the \ncustomer is changed just few days or weeks before the final financial transaction (like fund withdrawal, claim intimation ) is done or requested . The company may build additional checks before executing the transaction. \nii. Sum assured alterations i.e. increase or decrease of cover\nAny alteration to the risk cover should be dealt carefully and ascertained \nthat the same is initiated by the customer with appropriate disclosures.  \n\nCHAPTER 9  CONSUMER FRAUDS \n184 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE iii. Health checks undergone\nNormally this benefit is payable via refund of cost towards the health check \nundergone by the insured. Here the bills and documents submitted should be \nvalidated so as to ensure the customer has truly undergone the examination. \nThese transactions could vary based on the nature of product and \npermissible features of the product. Here, appropriate process controls have to be built so as not to misuse the system.  \nc) Claim settlement stage \nClaim settlement is the ultimate testimony for any insurance company and \ntherefore larger care is taken at underwriting stage so that claim settlement is done with ease.  \nProviding false/misleading information or withholding of material facts at \nthe time of applying for insurance; making a claim, taking a claim/payment; making a claim for a health service not utilised or making multiple claims for same loss/injury; altering / destroying / fabricating documents/ records are \nall covered under this stage.  \nThe various fraud scenarios at claim stage are: i. Submit false claim so as to seek benefit\nSince it involves payment of benefits of the policy holder monies, care has \nto be taken to ensure that the transaction is done ensuring all checks and \ncontrols.\nii.", "start_char_idx": 336087, "end_char_idx": 345824, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ffdab8b-600a-40e4-a3c3-2bb5252ead48": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ffdab8b-600a-40e4-a3c3-2bb5252ead48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "90097b64-5b3b-4a63-8302-c40398ca459c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffb90eacc289d7a1ff5ac76fe1810ac7292da3768dcaa3967f4e164415d4c092", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0271cb52-f3da-4214-a953-e02ac4caad6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a871373f543348b0dbcb63c34b31230ae0191bd6ccd9b95f82011b579d210afa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "b3032bc4-f6c8-4f98-ac16-cae77a84d3a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "099d1e3ca781ec5385be72dbe7b0b26cc0ae959e5c9b2b99692ec29f944c5500", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "fdfdc92a-fad6-4f36-a806-6a4436b6d509", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb7f56ce043c3e29173cf4d72915886ac23b22245fa07ee61effc9e1f059648e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "0422c9c5-bc94-450c-a0eb-45051c5d1398", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d47a6006a923724b1412e3e8f27a210eb8f4cd61e63860f5479c7883652277df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "9acdb1f7-df8d-47e9-9dd6-b08950acb80b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f5d82d85c618448fe3983b61e8cab2b9ee3a0390734bbe75c1d379b8b097960", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "ii. Provide erroneous address to claim benefitThe type of fraud is done by siphoning the policyholder\u2019s money where the \naddress is changed just before the claim is intimated. This will ensure that the claim benefit is now being sent at the new address without the actual beneficiary being aware about the same. To control such incidences, there \nare checks which the companies have put in place and important one being \nKYC document check before the payment is made to beneficiary. \niii. Inflation of medical bills/ extended LOS\nThis is the most common fraud in health insurance. Here, because of the \nstrong nexus between the provider and the customer often the insurance company is unable to manage/control this fraud.  \n\nCONSUMER FRAUDS  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  185The reason being: \n/g57The nature of documentation is quite appropriate for the treatment \ngiven;\n/g57The tariff charts for hospital are not well defined/ published and \n/g57There is good amount of subjectivity in defining the medical \nnecessity/protocol\nIt is due to these challenges, it has become quite difficult for the insurer \nto control and identify this behaviour. \nTo sum up, health insurance fraud can be committed at various points in the \nclaim transaction by different parties inclusive of claimants, policyholders, \nthird-party claimants and the professionals who provide services to claimants. The following are the some of the instances of fraud in health insurance. \nDiagram 4:Instances of fraud \nTest Yourself 4\nA category of consumer claim fraud in which a group involving consumers, \nagents, physicians, provider etc. make a false claim will be categorised as \n________.\nI. False claims \nII. Collusion with providers III. Insurance speculation IV. Fraud rings \n\nCHAPTER 9  FRAUD MITIGATION \n186 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE E. Fraud mitigation \nIt takes a concerted team effort to fight insurance frauds. No individual, \norganisation or agency has the resources to single-handedly stop all insurance frauds.\nToday, the situation is such that if a claim is found to be fraudulent, the insurer \njust repudiates the same. It does not go beyond that point as its financial liability is eliminated.  \nThe unfortunate reality is the fraudster goes scot free and continues this \npractice with another insurer and the vicious cycle keeps repeating. \nFraud detection mechanisms have to be robust and effective in eliminating any \nattempt to defraud the company.  \nIt is not easy for an organisation to deny liability which occurs during the policy \nlife cycle, especially when appropriate assessments / validations could have been done at policy inception stage. \nTable 9.1\nHuman interface / process \nimprovisation Technology and process interface \nCreation of fraud database Ease of data capture \nCreation of consumer awareness Comprehensive claims information \nRobust whistle blow policy Ability to detect fraud effectively \nEffective legislation and judicial \naction Extract data output in a desirable or \nactionable format \nFraud management philosophy and \npolicyRAG Analysis\nRobust investigation unit and mystery \nshopping  Propensity Modeling\nDoctor seeding Underwriting / Claims Rules Engine & \nBusiness Process Transformations \nTraining & communication Fraud investigations \nWelcome call Vigilance, Compliance checks \nPlugging process gaps Audits\nControl business when fraud is not manageable Enterprise Risks & Internal Controls \nFeedback to entities who are party to \nfraudControls through insurance covers \n\nFRAUD MITIGATION  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  187The fraud in insurance can be combated through the following combined \nefforts:\n1. Human interface or process improvisation   \na) Creation of fraud data base\nThis provides Information on frauds (comprising of agents; providers; \ndoctors; customers) not only serves as a powerful tool at the claim settlement stage but also at the time of underwriting. Such a data base must host all information about fr auds or suspicious transactions across all \ninsurance companies. In fact, the same should be extended and integrated \nwith other financial service institutions.  \nHowever, all frauds cannot be identified or picked only basis data analysis. \nTherefore organisations should use more than one form of techniques/measures to identify and control frauds. \nb) Create consumer awareness\nThe biggest battle to be won is that of educating the insuring public on the \nevils of insurance fraud and ways to prevent it.  \nA sustained campaign, similar to the ones released by the IT department to \ncombat tax evasion or by RBI on not sharing your internet banking passwords, would be required to sensitize the average insured towards this issue.  \nIt is only when insurance fraud is regarded as something 'shameful' and \n'criminal' by a large section of public; all other efforts will begin to bear fruit.\nc) Robust whistle blow policy As a sequel to building awareness, insurers and the regulator should actively \nencourage \"whistle-blow policy\" or just plain \"squealing\" on fraudsters. This \nshall not only protect the industry and consumers towards fraud but also \npenalize the ones involved in doing those.  \nd) Effective legislation and judicial action \nInsurance fraud deserves special legislation and judicial attention - a few \nquick, high-profile and highly publicised convictions are probably the strongest medicine for potential fraudsters. Without legislative and judicial \nsupport, all the activism of insurers and regulators will be rendered \ntoothless. \n\nCHAPTER 9  FRAUD MITIGATION \n188 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE e) Fraud management philosophy and policy \nCompany should have a \u201cZero tolerance\u201d towards fraud and fraudsters. On \nan internal level, companies will require to have a well laid out policy which \nmakes clear that fraud will not be tolerated. They will also need to have \ninternal measures to detect, investigate and prevent fraud - or have a Fraud Plan.\nf) Robust investigation unit and mystery shopping  \nCompanies should create dedicated risk control units who should promptly \ninvestigate on all frauds and suspicious transactions discreetly. \ng) Doctor seeding \nThis is nothing but the mystery shopping with respect to the Diagnostic \ncentres and Doctors wherein the seed (investigator) will disguise himself as a patient and will tell that he suffers from various diseases and ask the doctor to give a clean chit in the Medical Examination form of the Insurance application form.\nBased on the reactions of the doctor, the actions will be taken on the \ndoctors and also the previously medical examined cases by the Doctor. \nh) Training and communication Organisation must adequately invest in creating sensitivity on this subject. \nThe training and communication should be done as a part of induction or \nmonthly newsletters for all its stakeholders (i.e. employees, customer, \nintermediaries, partners and shareholders) and must cover various frauds scenarios, its prevention, and also provide action matrix for fraudsters. This way the company must create a fear factor in the minds of the people and create a strong deterrent.  \ni) Welcome calling \nCustomer after receiving the policies can be given a welcome call and the \nuntraceable numbers checked through field visits to verify the authenticity of the address and for the presence of any bogus customers. \nj) Plugging process gaps quickly \nFraud if not identified can spread like a communicable disease and leaves \nwith a far bigger impact for the organization. Hence the golden rule should, \nif one identifies fraud, plug it immediately before it is too late and ensure \nadequate control are taken for it not to be repeated in further.   \n\nFRAUD MITIGATION  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  189k) Control business where fraud is not manageable \nThis is not what many organisations want to accept or follow. If all the \nprocesses or control measures fail to curb fraud then a call needs to be \ntaken to stop doing business in that format.  \nExample\nF o r  e x a m p l e ,  i f  c a s h  a s  a  m o d e  o f  p a y m e n t  i s  l e a d i n g  t o  m a n y  c a s h  \ndefalcations, then cash as a paymen t mode should be stopped, if a \nparticular geography or area is raising many fraudulent claims, company may \ntake call to stop sourcing policies from there. \nl) Feedback to entities who are party to fraud \nSometimes it is difficult to ascertain fraud or confirm whether the party \ninvolved has done the same with a fraudulent intent. Therefore the \ncompany must investigates the matter and provide appropriate warning to all parties concerned/involved. This shall ensure effective control and sensitisation from a future perspective.   \nMany of the companies also have the \u2019penal action matric\u2019 which conveys \nthe list of disciplinary actions taken against the employees for various types of fraud. These are agreed and signed by the employees as well before \njoining the insurance company. \nInsurance fraud is a serious issue that insurance companies, law enforcement \nagencies and the industry regulator are confronted with. As health insurance business is growing fast, leading to an increase in magnitude, complexity and variety of frauds. To tackle the menace, insurers, regulators and enforcement agencies all need to work together to minimise the ill effects of fraud on the entire Industry. \n2.

The reason being, if complete claims data is not available, then the system will not be able to display fraud triggers/alerts effectively thereby making it difficult for the claim assessors to detect frauds.   \n\nCHAPTER 9  FRAUD MITIGATION \n190 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE b) Comprehensive claims information\nTo ensure robust fraud management and pick up relevant fraud alerts, the \nsystem should have comprehensive data fields. Importantly to avoid \nproblems of poor data quality, system must have effective validations for \ndata consistency check.\nc) Ability to detect fraud effectivelyIn order to successfully prevent fraud, the methods or logic deployed should \nbe able to provide fast results. The system should be able to detect frauds based on the rules and logic defined to identify various frauds.  \nFew examples of various frauds which the system should be able to easily \nidentify are: \ni. Adverse claim ratio for an agent or partner or group \nii. Adverse claim ratio for a given profile/ occupation/ income group \niii. Higher LOS ( length of stay) for a given ailment iv. Higher treatment cost for a given ailment  \nd) Extract data output in a desirable or actionable format\nThis is an important activity as all the data captured should be available to \nthe management in a desirable format with all possible data cuts thereby making it easier for decision making and regulatory reporting.  \ne) RAG (Red, Amber, Green) analysis\nThe entities that provide business are analysed on periodic basis and the \nworst performers in terms of claims (related to Hospitals, Agents, Diagnostic Centres) are assigned Red rating , mediocre performance are given Amber\nand positive results are assigned Green  through statistical analysis and \nsegment classification mechanisms.  \nThe Red category are continuously monitored and counselled to take actions \naccordingly including but not limited to Termination. \nf) Propensity modellingPropensity modelling aims at identifying the potential fraudsters based on \nthe past experience, backed by data analytics such that the business coming through the proper channel are kept on high alert so that fraudulent business is not entering the company books. Many a times, the insurance \ncompany\u2019s system itself picks up the cases without any whistle blowing.  \n\nFRAUD MITIGATION  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  191Very importantly, based on such proactive sampling investigations, even the \nissued policies are cancelled on suo-moto basis backed by the Sec.45 of the Insurance Act. \ng) Underwriting / claims rules engine & business process transformations \nThese days most of the underwriting rules and claims rules are built up in \nthe system through various rules such that 80% of the generic and genuine claims are processed automatically.  \nThis leaves sufficient time for the expert claims managers to analyse the \ncomplex and high claim cases. Business Process Transformation (BPT) tools \nalso enable the insurers to make quick changes in the rules. \nh) Fraud investigations\nA specialised community has emerged within the insurance sector with \nknowledge about various types of frauds that are happening and also various new methods of investigations that are implemented to crack the frauds.  \nThis also reduces the life of the frauds cycle and also helps to include \nstricter underwriting and claim rules. \ni) Vigilance, compliance checksVigilance checks, surprise audits are often conducted by the company and \nbased on the findings, actions are taken accordingly. \nj) Audits\nFrauds are also identified through various types of Audits conducted by \nInternal Audit, Risk Audit & External Audit departments. \nk) Enterprise risks and internal controls\nSimilarly Enterprise Risks & Internal Controls department oversees all the \nprocesses of the company in a comprehensive manner and check whether all \nthe processes are available in an integrated manner.  \nThe departments continuously receive input from the various stakeholders \nand the market intelligence and ensure that the process gaps are integrated and plugged.

Introduction to reinsurance\nB. Utility of reinsurance \nC. Health insurance and reinsurance models  \nD. Niche products supported by reinsurers  \nE. Criteria used to decide on reinsurance programs \n\nCHAPTER 10  INTRODUCTION TO REINSURANCE \n200 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Look at this Scenario \nReinsurance protects a primary insurer from catastrophic losses and allows \ninsurers to better predict and manage their risk.   \nHealth insurers often use reinsurance to protect against major medical expenses \nthat can arise from, for example, someone needing an organ transplant. Health reinsurance operates in the background and doesn\u2019t interact directly with \ninsured. \nA. Introduction to reinsurance \nReinsurance is a risk transfer mechanism. It provides a method for insurance \ncompanies to diversify their risks by contributing a part of the premium \nreceived from customers to a reinsurance company, and receiving the \ncorresponding claims incurred from the reinsurance company.  \nDefinition \nReinsurance is the acceptance by one or more insurers, called reinsurers or assuming companies, of a portion of the risk underwritten by another insurer \nthat has contracted with an employer for the entire coverage. \nThe diagram below shows the basic flow of premiums and claims \u2013 between the \ncustomer, the insurance company and the reinsurance company.  \nDiagram 1: Basic flow of premiums and claims \nInsurance companies receive premiums from customers. This includes premiums \nreceived from corporate customers for products such as property insurance, marine hull insurance, marine cargo insurance, group health and similar covers. \nThey also receive premiums from individual customers for health insurance, \nmotor insurance, householders insurance etc.  \nOn the happening of a covered event, insurance companies pay out claims to \ncustomer.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO REINSURANCE  CHAPTER 10 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  201Definition  \nAs the name suggests \u2013 \u201cRe-insurance\u201d is, at its simplest level, - \u201cinsurance for \ninsurers\u201d.   \n1. Quota share reinsurance \nDefinition  \nWhen the reinsurance contract is proportional to the original insurance contract, it is called quota share reinsurance.  \nIn such cases, typically a certain percentage of the original premium received \nfrom the customer is paid to the reinsurance company and the corresponding percentages of claims are received from the reinsurance company.  \nExample\nIn the case of a 30% quota share, the insurer transfers 30% of its liability and premiums on every risk to the reinsurer, who must pay 30% of any loss sustained, whether total or partial. \nThe percentage is constant throughout and applies to premiums and losses \nalike. \n2. Surplus share reinsurance \nAn alternative to the quota share reinsurance is where all premiums above a \ncertain amount is ceded (paid)  to the reinsurer and all claims above the same \namount are received from the reinsurer.  \nDefinition  \nA form of pro rata reinsurance indemnifying the ceding company against loss to the extent of the surplus insurance liability ceded, on a share basis similar to \nquota share. \n3. Excess of loss \nBoth the above-mentioned structures work at a \u201c per policy \u201d level.  \nA third reinsurance structure \u2013 which is structured at a portfolio level  \u2013 exists, \nand is called an \u201c Excess of Loss \u201d reinsurance structure (sometimes called a \nStop Loss Cover ).", "start_char_idx": 364409, "end_char_idx": 373821, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b47f35d-700c-4ae9-84e0-82d14589e026": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b47f35d-700c-4ae9-84e0-82d14589e026", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3351e06d-5e92-49b5-a669-63af7322dc66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "740d6e5f8b2c6c230163363f87a98b8a9f5551f1a7612531a864c6590fdc10df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "19ef9763-278b-4101-8ecb-782b9dd1b148", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37d3a383d96eead39a9c9809492784be9373df1de38f55088c64b596f6922782", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "500b14c7-0612-4369-b910-6d95dd88ade5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b7320b82d0d5177b67670e48838bb8cc81172e62431a768b9b44ffab5395e621", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "e1eca586-6b38-4fd3-8c2b-4772120f5954", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "af250c849608635d6ae317cb3651a0afae1816552087ed9e5438924fe6f3d7dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "b67b4219-d14b-4df3-a91c-fffd356d89e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4d497a7846920a73c08ef200d6ed30ac0be761e552c13c3ec2e5c82ce24f9fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "b25ca41a-f338-4ec5-9937-19df59189fe6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58dc2e642916d1a0fb512cce8e98f41c1bbf89bd5f12aab8aaab59baf3ecc121", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "254aacbb-a064-4db7-8d02-b3a8fe8f12ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "595edde0c7635ee2a5e92cf61ceb14c71c7aea6a9d697f5e2b285db4331c8937", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "CHAPTER 10  INTRODUCTION TO REINSURANCE \n202 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Definition  \nExcess of loss reinsurance: a form of reinsurance that indemnifies the ceding \ncompany for the portion of a loss that exceeds its own retention. \nIn this structure, when the claims  ratio for a given block of business goes \nbeyond a certain level, the reinsurer would be on risk to pay for these claims.  \nExample \nConsider the following: \u201cA stop loss cover, which operates between 110% and \n135% claims ratio\u201d. \nIn this case, the reinsurer would liable to pay for claims when the portfolio \nclaims ratio increases beyond 110%, and would continue to be liable to pay till the upper limit of 135% of claims ratio is achieved.  \nBeyond this level, claims would be paid by the insurance company itself.  \nDiagram 2: Forms of reinsurance \nTest Yourself 1\nWhich of the following is incorrect with regards to reinsurance? \nI. Reinsurance is insurance for insurers \nII. Reinsurance is a risk transfer mechanism III. Reinsurance is a transaction between insurance companies IV. Reinsurance does not require underwriting skills \n\nUTILITY OF REINSURANCE  CHAPTER 10 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  203B. Utility of reinsurance \nReinsurance serves as a risk transfer mechanism for insurance companies.  \nExample \nA single event such a flood or an earthquake can lead to a large number of \nclaims for the insurer. This could result in a situation where the insurer is subject to significant pressure on liquidity \u2013 and if the claims are large enough \u2013 could result in the insurer having to liquidate assets to pay for the claims.  \nA reinsurance structure provides the insurer with the ability to equalise claims \npay-outs as well as manage liquidity.  \nAnother dimension to the usefulness of reinsurance is the fact that reinsures \nprovides technical assistance \u2013 especially with reference to pricing and underwriting complex risks \u2013 to insurance companies.  \nSometimes, reinsurance is also viewed as the cost of accessing these skills \u2013 \nespecially in nascent markets or where a market has been de-tariffed and previous pricing mechanisms may no longer be valid.  \nThe final dimension to understanding the utility of reinsurance is linked to the \nfact that in many markets, the use of reinsurance helps an insurance company optimize the amount of capital it has to hold for solvency purposes.   \nThis works as follows: \na) Reinsurance means that the risk of payment of a claim is partly or fully \ntransferred to the reinsurer.  \nb) For an insurer, the amount of capital to be maintained is linked to the \namount of business that it has written. When business is reinsured, conceptually speaking, the insurance company has recourse to a reinsurer for payment of claims. That means that, in theory, the insurance company does not need to hold capital to the extent of reinsured business.  \nIn practice, market regulations limit the extent to which an insurance \ncompany can take this \u201ccapital credit\u201d.  \nExample \nIn India, for health insurance, the prevailing regulations are such that an insurer \ncan get partial credit for reinsured business.  \n\nCHAPTER 10  UTILITY OF REINSURANCE \n204 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE c) This capital credit argument is important \u2013 because the shareholders of \nthe insurance company would always want to reduce the amount of capital used \u2013 so that they can maximise returns.  \nTo understand how an insurance company will design and use its reinsurance \nprogram, consider the following grid:  \nDiagram 3: Design and use of reinsurance program \nB. Quota share or\nsurplusA. Not reinsuredC. Quota share and\nStop LossD. Stop Loss\nClaim SeverityClaim Frequency\nLow\n< Rs 50,000High\n>10% p.a. \nHigh\n> 500,000Low\n< 1%pa\nThe grid shows claims severity \u2013 i.e. the average pay-out per claim on the Y \naxis. For illustrative purposes this is shown from Low (< Rs. 50,000 per \nclaim) to High (> Rs. 500,000 per claim).  \nSimilarly, claim frequency is shown on the X axis \u2013 where claims which occur \nless than 1% per annum are classified as low, and those which occur more than 10% per annum are classified as high. (Note that the scales are illustrative).\nThe grid shows the utility of reinsurance structures in light of the underlying \nnature of the insurance business:  \ni. Typically claims which are low severity and low frequency are not \nreinsured.  \nii. Claims which are medium to high severity and low frequency may be \nreinsured.  \nUsually, when an insurance company starts up business, it would chose to \nreinsure this segment of business \u2013 because it would not have built up enough reserves to be able to abs orb adverse claims experience.  \n\nUTILITY OF REINSURANCE  CHAPTER 10 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  205Also, the typical structure used would be a quota share or a surplus \nreinsurance structure.  \niii. Claims which are high frequency and high severity would usually be \nreinsured. Usually such businesses would be reinsured on a quota share \nbasis (so that the insurer gets the benefit of risk diversification as well as liquidity smoothing).  \niv. Claims which are high frequency but low severity - typically such \nbusiness is reinsured only at a portfolio level \u2013 i.e. using stop loss type of reinsurance structures.  \nHowever, some companies may, in the initial years, choose to proportionally \nreinsure this business, especially if there is a risk of mis-pricing.  \nIn other words, if companies are not confident of their ability to price the \nbusiness (e.g.in situations where past claims frequency (or incidence) data is not available or considered flawed, companies may opt to reinsure this category of business.)  \nNow, consider a general insurance company which sells property (fire - all \nrisks), marine cargo, marine hull, health and motor insurance.  \ni. Typically, the average pay-out per claim for fire, marine cargo and \nmarine hull will be high; and claims frequency will also be in the medium t o  h i g h  r a n g e .

For motor and health insurance, claims pay-out will be in the low to \nmedium range; however claims frequency could be in the high range.   \nTherefore, insurance companies tend to use portfolio reinsurance structures \nsuch as stop loss covers to manage the risks of these businesses.  \nTest Yourself 2\nWhich of the following claims are typically not reinsured? \nI. High severity and low frequency \nII. Low severity and low frequency \nIII. High severity and high frequency IV. Low severity and high frequency \n\nCHAPTER 10  HEALTH INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE MODELS \n206 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE C.Health insurance  and reinsurance models  \nTo understand how health reinsurance operates, globally and in an Indian \ncontext, it\u2019s important to appreciate the following aspects:\nFirstly, health insurance includes the following product lines:  Diagram 4: Product lines of health insurance \n1. Indemnity health insurance  \nThe insurance cover pays for the actual cost of the health episode. In India, this \nproduct line is generically given the name of \u201cMedi-claim\u201d \u2013 usually these covers have an average sum insured of Rs.100,000 and they cover the cost of hospitalisation episodes only.  \n2. Critical Illness insurance It covers not only the cost of the ailment or disease but also the loss of earnings \nassociated with the same. The number of ailments / surgeries and disease \ncovered are smaller in number (usually 12 to 15 conditions) \u2013 but tend to be clinically and financially intensive (e.g. Cancer, Heart Attack, Stroke, Kidney Failure etc.).  \nIn other words, these are conditions which will have an impact on the long term \nearning capacity of the customer; hence the cover also pays for the loss of earnings / lifestyle associated with the onset or diagnosis of the disease.  \n3. Fixed benefit covers \nThese are similar to indemnity health insurance in that, they cover inpatient \nhospitalisations. However they pay a fixed amount \u2013 usually per day of hospitalisation as well as a fixed amount for each category of surgery that the patient undergoes.  \nFrom the above, it should be apparent that fixed benefits and indemnity health \ninsurance covers would have similar patterns of claims incidence. Pay-outs for fixed benefits are smaller than those of indemnity health covers.   \n\nHEALTH INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE MODELS  CHAPTER 10 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  207Important\nTypical claims incidence benchmarks are in the 5% to 7% range per annum \n(which also correlates with IRDA published figures for India), and average claim pay-out for indemnity could be Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 while, while for fixed benefits it\u2019s about Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000.  \nBecause, both these products fall into the high frequency, low severity category \n\u2013 they are usually reinsured using a portfolio approach.", "start_char_idx": 373823, "end_char_idx": 382678, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19ef9763-278b-4101-8ecb-782b9dd1b148": {"__data__": {"id_": "19ef9763-278b-4101-8ecb-782b9dd1b148", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6417ec52-9581-49d7-9d36-f49aca3cdf48", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e3f12cec0fd9436c46d11a09ca2e7930655d96f996f4260149400fb107911d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b47f35d-700c-4ae9-84e0-82d14589e026", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "176d93b6fa04040d63fad5af9863866c7743af05d24d5b9488c69b037364c50e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa992fb7-c7b2-4eb8-9668-f3eff1f6c356", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "45ed5cb733aceb326e8a700420131e57db9736115dd20b169e7f07a245fad414", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "710ad663-532e-4a85-b74e-e6e435e00e6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "152b7ec7838da0f0a07a6da937a65634cfae392ac34e5b6c8e124fa89f19e0be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "db117c7f-a364-4359-be92-aef066454b5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b771a27b5af8003a881c98d4354c22733487eb5bab71c40d73c3060715df62f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "fe852678-6e2e-41e4-8308-e02cf56ed033", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7be59d1f197d37f739ada158543da324cc2df430258317438714c25b42043307", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "731c74e3-60dc-425c-9ec9-7e96637508ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e50955f936cc590d6cfe74f3d1d85da059ed97b498353a305887043dfd7fdbae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "7a502bb0-773e-4311-8117-1372f7fe5675", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a32a5438b111425ba136992869293bda3839b4c5e1dde47e2dacb0502626836", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Critical illness products tend to have lower claim incidence (fewer conditions \nare covered) but much higher pay-out per claim (this could be as high as Rs 50 lakhs even in existing retail products). Therefore, these tend to be reinsured using quota share structures.  \nAnother aspect which is important \u2013 and specific to the Indian market is that in \nIndia, health insurance products are sold by non-life companies ,life\ncompanies  as well as Stand Alone Health Insurance (SAHI)  companies.  \nEach of these three segments tends to use reinsurance differently \u2013 as shown \nbelow:\na) Life insurance companies: use quota share / surplus structures for the \nCritical Illness Insurance that they sell.  While some of them have used \nquota share reinsurance for fixed benefit products \u2013 this has been mostly at inception \u2013 and in order to obtain pricing assistance from reinsurers.  \nb) Non-Life companies: do not reinsure the indemnity medical insurance \nproduct except with stop loss covers. The reason is that, in the context of the other businesses that they write (such as fire, marine etc.), they would not find value in basic quota share or surplus reinsurance. \nc) SAHI companies: also use stop-loss reinsurance covers. In addition, since \nthese companies write only health insurance \u2013 they would use stop loss cover with lower triggers than those used by non-life companies.  \nThe final dimension to consider in the context of health reinsurance is that in \nIndia, rural and social sectors are increasingly looking at commercial health insurance as a delivery channel.  \nExample \nMost of the state governments subsidise the premium on rural schemes covering \nspecific segments (e.g. textile weavers, tea pickers etc.).  \n\nCHAPTER 10  HEALTH INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE MODELS \n208 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE In addition, the central government has also implemented the Rashtriya \nSwasthiya Bima Yojana (RSBY)  which is a social insurance scheme, which \ncovers the entire population of a given district for a basic level of health insurance cover. Similar health insurance schemes have also been started in \nvarious states. \nRural and social insurance schemes may have higher claims incidence than the \n\u201cmediclaim\u201d type of covers especially if these schemes cover outpatient as well as inpatient treatment. At the same time, the average claims pay-out is much lower\nExample \nThe sum insured in micro-ins urance schemes is Rs 30,000 or less, which means \nthat these products are one-third the average \u201csize\u201d of the mediclaim product \nlines \u2013 it also means that the average claim pay-out would be much lower than \nthe mediclaim business.   \nSo, per se, there is very little merit in considering any of the quota share or \nsurplus reinsurance covers \u2013 especially since the premium is subsidized by the government.  \nHowever, reinsurance has an important part to play at the portfolio level \u2013 for \nexample, a stop loss cover for the entire government sponsored health insurance scheme portfolio would be useful to the insurer to manage its books.  \nTest Yourself 3\nWhich of the following companies do not reinsure the indemnity medical insurance product except with stop loss covers? \nI.

Niche products supported by reinsurers \nThis section describes briefly some of the niche products which reinsurers \nsupport.\nDiagram 5: Niche products supported by reinsurers \n1. Employers Stop Loss (ESL) \nAs the name suggests, this is a stop loss cover sold to large companies (usually \nwith more than 50,000 employees) where the reinsurer undertakes to pay for medical insurance claims beyond the stop loss trigger, and may or may not offer administration services up to the stop loss limit.  \nThese stop loss covers are also bundled with third party administration (TPA) \nservices \u2013i.e. the health insurance benefits for the employee are managed by a \nTPA (or equivalent company).  \nThe main thing to note is that there is no insurance company involved here \u2013 the \nreinsurance company sells its risk transfer services to the corporate, and the scheme is administered by a TPA or equivalent company.   \nLarge corporates often find that their claims ratios are relatively predictable \u2013 \nand therefore they require risk diversification only at the portfolio level \u2013 hence \nthese structures have evolved.   \nIn India, the regulations around ESL are unclear- though it is likely that a \ncorporate can purchase a high deductible cover, which is effectively reinsurance, but from a direct insurer.  \n\nCHAPTER 10  NICHE PRODUCTS SUPPORTED BY REINSURERS \n210 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE 2. White labelling \nDefinition \nWhite labelling refers to a structure where the reinsure designs the entire \ninsurance product \u2013 i.e., pricing, underwriting and claims management process, \nand the insurance company acts as a distributor for the product.  \nUsually, such arrangements are on quota share basis. \nThese are popular in some markets such as South Africa as well as some of the \nSouth East Asian markets such as Singapore and Malaysia \u2013 and they do provide the market as a whole with access to products which would not otherwise be available.  \n3. Social reinsurance  \nSocial reinsurance is a variant of white-labelling in the context of rural \ninsurance. Here NGO\u2019s (Non-governmental organisati ons) play the role of the \ndistributor and \u201coutsource\u201d the design and administration of the entire insurance product to an insurance company wh o effectively acts as a reinsurer.  \nIn other words, the NGO provides access to \u201ccustomer touch\u201d functions (e.g. \nsales, claims intimation, underwriting) in a cost efficient manner.  \nHowever the product design, controls over underwriting and claims \nmanagement are designed and implemented by the (re)insurance company.  \nThese are popular in some of the African market such as Kenya, Uganda and \nTanzania \u2013 and these structures have evolved in those markets since the local insurance companies do not have the skills to design and price rural health insurance products and the regulations also do not require that such products be \nsold only by local insurance companies.  \nTest Yourself 4\nA situation where the insurance is marketed under the name of the agent is \nknown as __________ \nI.

Criteria used to decide on reinsurance programs \nAn insurance company will consider the following factors while designing its \nannual reinsurance program:  \n1. Current size of portfolio  and claims volatility : the larger the portfolio, the \nlower the volatility and the lower the inherent need for reinsurance.   \n2. The extent of capital  \u201ccredit\u201d available from reinsurance.  \n3. The extent of technical support  needed from the insurer (sometimes \ninsurance companies look at reinsurance pay-outs as a trade-off to obtain the necessary skills) \n4. Extent of product innovation  under consideration for the next year: if the \ncompany plans to introduce new products where there is not enough clarity on the expected claims experience, then reinsurance provides a valuable source of risk mitigation.  \n5.Mandatory reinsurance requirements : many countries have regulations \nwhich mandate that a certain amount of business must be reinsured.  \nExample \nIn India, 10% of all business written by all general insurance companies must compulsorily be ceded to the GIC Re- General Insurance Corporation of India, \nwhich includes all health business underwritten by them. \nTest Yourself 5\nWhich of the following factors are considered by an insurance company while \ndesigning its annual reinsurance program? \nI.

Over the last few years, several attempts have been made for structured learning events in health insurance. Industry chambers like FICCI and CII have \nheld annual workshops around this theme, it features prominently in the \ncurriculum of management schools, especially those involved in insurance courses; another prominent early effort in this direction was a one-week course developed by the Ministry of Health, WHO India and the Institute of Public Health which has been offered about once a year since 2006.

The formal qualifications offered by the Insurance Institute of India have been enthusiastically pursued by thousands of students every year, and I hope that a similar enthusiasm awaits the new health \ninsurance specialization which this material endeavours to pioneer. \nI am humbled by the trust reposed in me by the Insurance Institute of India, and \nam particularly thankful to Mr Sharad Shrivastava and Mr B S Rathaur in the institute for their unfailing support in developing this course material.

I drew heavily from \nour experience and association in developing a training manual and in \nconducting a series of face-to-face health insurance courses for managers of health insurance schemes in government and non-profit organizations, and I must thank Dr N Devadasan and Dr Sunil Nandraj who pioneered the concept and believed in it.  \nThis publication could not have been in your hands if it had not been for the \ndedicated efforts of the contributors, briefly listed on the next page. They are \nall busy professionals, and have been able to devote time amidst their already \nvery hectic schedules, driven entirely by their passion and commitment for this subject. Indeed, I have often required them to take time off their vacations and weekends to be able to meet our ambitious timelines and they have always been supportive and understanding and have delivered excellent learning material, and on time.  \n\nLast, but certainly not the least, I must thank Garima and Meyher, for being so \nconsiderate with me as I worked through weekends and late nights in making my small contribution to this very noble cause- much of the time I devoted was legitimately theirs.

Meaning of health insurance \n1. Health insurance \nAs we all are aware that future is unpredictable and rather, uncertain. \nAny person can meet with illness, bodily injury or any accident due to some \nunfortunate or unexpected event at any point of time. A lot of expenses are incurred due to such events like hospital stay, medicines, surgery, doctor\u2019s visit and other medical expenses. \nHealth Insurance provides coverage towards all or few of such healthcare needs \nand medical expenses incurred by a person. \nDefinition \nHealth Insurance is a way to distribute the financial risk associated with the variation of individual\u2019s health care expenditures by pooling costs over time (pre-payment) and over people (pooling). \n(OECD 2004) \nThis definition explains how the health insur ance system works. The health \ninsurance  insures an individual from expenses incurred due to any variation in \ntheir health. It collects an upfront contribution from an individual (commonly known as premium in the market) and pools it over many people.", "start_char_idx": 2006, "end_char_idx": 4314, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f89d1a3-f636-409f-813c-6bc769e44152": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f89d1a3-f636-409f-813c-6bc769e44152", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "826a47a5-c1d0-4d41-aea8-063a10869b73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cd1f4603674c31d0ad746d1f62e945366488b720e22165f9337e55dd2f50af1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5beb1d18-d601-45ea-97e0-69573d99e36b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6410444ccd2965cfc21dd2e7738c1eb693f1d680bb6ecd2bca2855d478f0adbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e1a0c7f4-dc96-4b4a-a4b9-f5e5070b20da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ddbbbb014c1c42b4ca9684b517dca220f931a731e0ee8ae8b2bb2cd8974b9a91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "826a47a5-c1d0-4d41-aea8-063a10869b73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cd1f4603674c31d0ad746d1f62e945366488b720e22165f9337e55dd2f50af1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "d6979ed1-8627-4161-8521-0ec5168c47ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b023d11bfecb30027d3a6929fdc202682d81bc5e3937e3fd7aed0d39e16d6164", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "95110b39-80a0-4adf-acbf-784ce30baa04", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e28409a1f2f91b1a386aa34950f3106838481eaa5caa4a63ca2fdfc1ebf35f2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "40b5aac5-ac14-40b6-8570-b53dc35b5c6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "06b69cd58f1cd0649d2cfb99ef0c5c81ab52ba66e272f449ab5ab1ce4e53cc2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "56440ae9-cbf9-415a-a663-a91fc714f836", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e3329299923e07d7066a69a7b02eaae5ad551f2c1b28bbe2e00d403bb164ae18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "400978f9-e918-4c4d-89ff-04d4e75adfe4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4112c763e95092232b93b9df39a843037d69d0e9070e2c5f500d615cd57d7788", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Thus it works very similar to all the other types of insurance in the market, the only difference being that it primarily covers health expenses of an individual. \n2. Commercial health insurance \nThe health insurance which is offered by insurance companies is commonly \nknown as Private Health Insurance or Commercial Health Insurance. Commercial \nhealth insurance term is used to avoid confusion between public insurance companies which are owned by the government and the private insurance companies. Therefore, it will be used interchangeably throughout this study text.\nCommercial health insurance basically provides coverage to an individual \ntowards all or some of the health services defined under a contractual \nagreement, health insurance policy  made between both of them.

It plays a major role in \nthe health insurance as it is the one who decides and provides: \na) The type of health services to be used by an individual i.e. insured. \nb) How much of such services are used \nc) How much is the cost of those services \nThe involvement of this third party makes this insurance different and complex \ntoo. \nExample \nRavi met with an accident while going to his office and had serious injuries.", "start_char_idx": 4315, "end_char_idx": 6467, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1a0c7f4-dc96-4b4a-a4b9-f5e5070b20da": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1a0c7f4-dc96-4b4a-a4b9-f5e5070b20da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "826a47a5-c1d0-4d41-aea8-063a10869b73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cd1f4603674c31d0ad746d1f62e945366488b720e22165f9337e55dd2f50af1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f89d1a3-f636-409f-813c-6bc769e44152", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5c39d06a6ac3aa6f2ba9cf906c1bebe3cc6404be81f91a02dba9b63b03fe1f54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "99d921a8-55e8-48e3-932e-a946181b4ffe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "20b7b679f233237281b89a37653819f57033a111b009de049d74a92c48af53d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "826a47a5-c1d0-4d41-aea8-063a10869b73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cd1f4603674c31d0ad746d1f62e945366488b720e22165f9337e55dd2f50af1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "fff952de-3a54-41e0-ac94-ef53981d1bd2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "625beafd3ab7ee4520d157eaa9f3b203981d9fd394ad37441b0f2cd2d8549259", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "2b260838-b22b-4eb3-84ae-ec2521bb9cdd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5a187971ce1082f84f599ae8805e4304f74c412d6a9404cf65824bc1b203e9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "9d2e976e-9c34-452d-9b44-8d34a353694a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b724e8417de6975382d51d4d0ebd2fcf603f7adc4c9578b11698d55dcef42ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "6202e0bc-8e1a-4a7f-b9a1-321c49d4d690", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "96bd2503672d392d4b8b60f1d7f1cb1bb6a08b3436390cadedcbd0d4eace1c5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "2a4aeba0-9510-4ab0-8efa-5897cdb7f169", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30b7b7addb558f5a779e49341bebbdbbdb2e399d1a81c7b2970bb2c3f7f9617b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Example \nRavi met with an accident while going to his office and had serious injuries.

Health insurance market \nEconomists describe health insurance as an \u2018imperfect market\u2019 because normal \nmarket forces do not work as expected in this case. \nThe imperfections in this market are mainly due to the following reasons: \na) Information asymmetry \nThe information available to both insurer and insured about each other is \neither incomplete or not completely transparent. \nThe insureds mostly do not understand the exact interpretation, meaning \nand coverage of their contact.

There are mainly two types of moral hazards: \ni. Demand side moral hazard: It works at insured\u2019s end. A consumer with a \nhealth insurance will make use of and accept more health services than he would have otherwise taken without any health insurance. \nii. Supply side moral hazard: It works at the end of Health providers. They \nstart suggesting and providing more health services as well to more expensive treatment to the person having health insurance.  \nVarious cost containment mechanisms are use by the health insurers to \nminimise these moral hazards which will be discussed in the later chapters. \nExample \nMahesh, aged 28 years had taken a health insurance from a private insurance \ncompany that provides for reimbursement of the expenses incurred on health. \nHe is normally a very healthy person. \nOne day he had some food in a party which resulted in stomach disorder for \nhim. Usually in such cases, he will take some medicines at home and will take some routine care to recover. But as he was having an insurance policy this time, he thought of using it by going to an expensive hospital for check-up. \nHe went there and the doctor there suggested him to undergo some expensive \ntests and hospitalise him for a couple of days for full recovery. Taking into consideration his insurance policy coverage, he opted for the best room to stay in the hospital. He ended up with a heavy amount of bill in the hospital which his insurance company had to reimburse. \nHence, this example clearly indicates that an insurance coverage had made \nMahesh behave differently, with less consideration towards his medical bills which he otherwise would have not incurred if he did not have any insurance coverage to pay for his bills. \nAt the demand side, Mahesh incurred more expenses towards health services \nthan required.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2346, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c41f0ee1-6773-48d2-976d-6ff3275df8c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c41f0ee1-6773-48d2-976d-6ff3275df8c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f45b7e20-1aee-41c0-b4a6-defd63fbed53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a7729d75359fda497857e2137eef50d20072112496c09f03a73d5a67f451f3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc82c2ad-f572-4e3e-b732-dde93c3f49cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2bd7d21b3277423e13c9b710b84f0b94c657319871e0c0d407ba9e1f4a1e9f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ee76fbd-9393-4fa1-ba99-9e695a51849c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8661b4bc5e3a3be1e73e741a38eef6b51a77cc57016ce68077498086df3e647", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "f45b7e20-1aee-41c0-b4a6-defd63fbed53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a7729d75359fda497857e2137eef50d20072112496c09f03a73d5a67f451f3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "cc766dd0-87a7-48ce-bb15-2b116ae71903", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c166e563a74181b7c3f6028271973c557718179b2e47aec41f0777018d5dc3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "7e01673e-97bb-4dde-ab60-5883d880a956", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "296bafe69ac58273145af0c0ca51766cde995ef2cdce6558d834ecb23d82e54f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "4d5870d2-db9f-44c3-b35d-036074d6d3b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1bd59705fdb88d6f702378c1b366e70968ff5132b082da8b852b999a8c75ce93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "74b0fc83-53f9-4d7a-8e5d-5e98d054f482", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "581f1fb0cceb6f051f031389047a9e301e67243ee2f0f39ccf0d98d14e83b404", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "9bc66eaa-b159-4224-bdcd-484b8aab87a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "09edde394f1726f616922c501898b41251d8a8f08e5274afd18568ef1d59c6c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "At the demand side, Mahesh incurred more expenses towards health services \nthan required.

Health insurance \u2013 a cover towards unpredictable illnesses \nThe out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by people in India on their health is \nvery high as compared to the other countries. It accounts for about 71% of all health expenditure in the country\n1,2\nDue to this, individuals have now started taking lead in planning for their own health expenditure especially when they can get it at an affordable cost. \nDue to unpredictable major illnesses, an individual may have to incur \nsubstantial amount of money from his savings at a short notice. According to an \nestimate, every year around 2.2% of India\u2019s population\n3,4 is leading towards \npoverty due to such illnesses. An illness may cause a potential impact on the finances of individuals and their families resulting in a catastrophic risk. \nHence, people realise that the planning for their health needs and taking an \nappropriate step to cover that risk is required. This resulted in millions of people opting for health insurance policy to  cover against such health risks.  \n2. Health insurance products in India \nHealth insurance products available in the Indian market are primarily \ndominated by hospitalisation products , which mean that these cover the high \nexpenses incurred by an individual during hospitalisation. These expenses are relatively high due to increasing cost of healthcare, surgical procedures, new and more expensive technology coming in the market and cost of newer \ngeneration of pharmaceuticals. With these increasing costs, it is really becoming \nvery difficult for an individual even if he is financially sound to bear such high expenses without any health insurance.   \nTherefore, a health insurance is important mainly for two reasons: \n/g57Providing financial access to healthcare providers  i n  c a s e  o f  a n y  \nillness.\n/g57Preservation of savings of an individual  which may otherwise be wiped \nout due to illness.", "start_char_idx": 2257, "end_char_idx": 4653, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ee76fbd-9393-4fa1-ba99-9e695a51849c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ee76fbd-9393-4fa1-ba99-9e695a51849c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f45b7e20-1aee-41c0-b4a6-defd63fbed53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a7729d75359fda497857e2137eef50d20072112496c09f03a73d5a67f451f3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c41f0ee1-6773-48d2-976d-6ff3275df8c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50b4ea8269e69ee38bb5d4b4d8d60f63f9ad1b3c292190ddacac05e0546778a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "47245278-c205-46ab-a1eb-b999acbfd7f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4bbe21b9de32a034ddfac579e1b52d1fb43eb450e43e80ee422482519ea41344", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "f45b7e20-1aee-41c0-b4a6-defd63fbed53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a7729d75359fda497857e2137eef50d20072112496c09f03a73d5a67f451f3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "50910f4f-c49b-41e0-bb6f-c26ad0d149a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cdc3e97ad3ed642aff77daba4baeaadeb4c89d614b52820d0d777507b708352b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "d0772cdd-c809-4e12-9afe-eda64f1bf7b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ea4c233cee87eb8d3c494517cb79145196d337916351f4736187f0510dadcdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "af1f0e85-7560-4b24-a128-1c37f20e90e2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50504d7543d97e794d11c9db5d3ff3f9dd1c40df641f85ce74987473f120822e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "5961c476-7115-41c3-927b-3bf1e10d2594", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd95cd790f7eed5c6127736c0afde16b2ecca070acf74644690d0daca746c1b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "01e8846c-5c90-465c-a491-ce5cffd1f12f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e40edf2478a5d20fe54da57d366f3b31ceffcbf254ea2b4ce31bdc99e81fdcf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "1 Mahal A, Sakthivel S, Nagpal S.

This act has been revised from time to time, but does remain at the core of insurance laws for the country\n5.\nThe regulatory structure, as well as the constituents of the industry, underwent \nseveral changes over the next 7 decades, characterized particularly by the following sets of events which shaped the course of the Indian insurance \nindustry: \na) Nationalisation of life insurance industry in 1956 to merge number of \nprivate insurers into one Life Insurance Corporation  (LIC). \nNationalisation of non-life industry similarly in 1973 to merge number of \nprivate non-life insurers into one General Insurance Corporation  (with \nfour subsidiary companies), all owned by the Government of India. \nb) Establishment of the Insurance Regulator  based on a report by Malhotra \nCommittee in 1994 on \u2018Reforms in the Insurance Sector\u2019. Earlier interim \nregulator was established in 1996 which was later formed as a statutory \nauthority in 2000.  This resulted in a new reform in the insurance industry.  \nc) Opening up of the market finally for a new generation of private insurers \nfrom August 2000. \n                                             \n5 IRDA.

But at the same time, social development particularly the development of the health sector has not been paid the required attention for with the same pace. A very less proportion of resources are allocated for the health sector.  \nAccording to some studies commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Family \nWelfare, the magnitude of health expenditure in India for the year 2008-09 was \nabout 4.13% of the GDP at current market prices.\n16, 17  \nHowever, in actual less than 1% of GDP is spent on the public health sector in \nIndia.\nA. Sources of funds for healthcare needs \nGlobally, the financing of the healthcare costs in any country is done through the following four methods: \n1. Government revenues and taxes  \nIn this system, the population contributes to the Government revenues \nindirectly via taxes, a share of which is then allocated by the Government for providing healthcare care services to the people. This is therefore also known as \ntax-funded system. Thus, the payment to the healthcare providers is made by \nthe Government on behalf of the users. \nExample \nIn UK, all residents are enrolled under National Health Services (NHS) which is primarily funded through the taxes paid to the Government.  It guarantees basic medical services to all residents of the UK by providing free medical treatment.", "start_char_idx": 1992, "end_char_idx": 4335, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d48c414-f30d-4673-9987-7195b4bcd977": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d48c414-f30d-4673-9987-7195b4bcd977", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9d6f0237-19b4-4bbe-a95b-cd36d84247c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea3c91a36f66686f3811307c3e538c3fe2acd4a1b699cc94b04efdb8800444cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dbd98ea7-909f-4cc8-b1c1-680aeb4adc1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "afad692fb1d308f211810ca8e1ea6cbfe6005b52bab4eff7eed95380e8fb477d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4ded608-4736-4de6-bd09-0780de0d8745", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f46f3adae6d74e38554a355daeacff0fc842375f509b735f92eaddb54a92c136", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "9d6f0237-19b4-4bbe-a95b-cd36d84247c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea3c91a36f66686f3811307c3e538c3fe2acd4a1b699cc94b04efdb8800444cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "2c47eb9a-e409-4ced-be35-4860d9dd4a7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "78b41d99d1c658acf0f4273292247788771f4a89e74247a8de42cf46b71a08d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "cfd62228-2808-420a-9d18-aeca6655a328", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75d11f0982134f92bd45f908b1c9df76c886282b7a42a01bd55e7df225a01db9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "88f1098e-1066-4429-845b-8c04685d151f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a1184bf89254e9a72a5ae757bb51b763e79d2559d054ebcafd7dcaf378b5532", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "f9eeb4b4-adb8-4aa3-bd95-c48524cb4820", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "39955c8557b2aff2faa3ecb37db60c06e3ab4b976e6951bc70c1ab5d4340439c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "50491774-d825-44c8-8169-f46027f6868b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "67406d78dbb5fe7ab64c784b21f849a13fc884fcf417622f0ec464624939cb54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "7c057d7b-99aa-4413-8f4d-7c5280022d0d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0e4572f450b46df81cdf02a272feffa7d1eb4c94e3f15b1fdcaf7f3582ba12f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "It guarantees basic medical services to all residents of the UK by providing free medical treatment.

Germany \nGermany has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. In Germany, over \n90 percent of the residents receive healthcare through the statutory health insurance. It functions through non-profit sickness funds that collect premiums from members and pay health care providers according to pre-negotiated agreements.\nEmployers and employees contribute equally in the premiums, which in the first \nhalf of the 1990s averaged between 12 and 13 percent of a worker's gross \nearnings up to the income ceiling\n19. Hence, in simple terms, health insurance \npremium is collected from employees as a payroll tax. As this is a social health insurance scheme, premiums are set according to the earnings rather than the risk. The premiums are not affected by a member's marital status, family size or health. The unemployed continue to be members of their sickness fund, and their contributions are paid by federal and local Government offices. The contributions of retired workers are paid by themselves from their pension \nfunds.\nExample \nThe health financing model of Germany is a perfect example of a public health \ninsurance financing model which redistributes from higher to lower income groups, from the healthy to the sick, from the young to the old, from the employed to the unemployed, and from those without children to those with children. Employees who have private insurance also receive the benefit of part \nof their premiums being paid by their employers. \n                                             \n18Adapted from Devadasan N, Nagpal S.

This plan is administered by the \nMunicipal Governments and is financed through compulsory premium on \nthe self-employed and general tax revenues. \nd) Long life medical care system\nThis plan was introduced in 1983 for the elderly person aged 75 and \nover. It also covers people aged 65 to 74 with certain certified disabilities. It is financed through a fixed nominal amount paid by the \ninsured (10%), contributions from the other plans (40%) and general tax \nrevenues (50%). \nAll these plans are required to cover a range of benefits, which include dental \ncare, maternity care, and prescription drugs. In 2008, over 80% of the health costs in Japan were borne by the Government and less than 20% came from private sources (just the opposite of the situation in India).", "start_char_idx": 4516, "end_char_idx": 6661, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e658ebe-23b7-4f6f-a54f-02ef4970a322": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e658ebe-23b7-4f6f-a54f-02ef4970a322", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c15afae2-72ed-4f43-85e9-04461d5f53f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58126b7f1fbe146c9638329221a1474775dcf7afe86c2f3cebc45bf215267be0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "16d023ce-b4d6-489e-89f1-42beaa0a59e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "71f21b4622df7968e1c485d4e567b559790d5f9a12d32bfd98227af1770cc018", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ebed9a4-eaed-4111-99d1-cccdecf9ef54", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9ac8b8d61e2c21b45f5dfe7226e5ff360e8dd5b16dc016bfedb8f0762ac8be7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "c15afae2-72ed-4f43-85e9-04461d5f53f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58126b7f1fbe146c9638329221a1474775dcf7afe86c2f3cebc45bf215267be0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "5f1da4f5-12a4-493e-b26f-0dafe4ea4571", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e332c09e43205b4a6070c0f457d5259a0b7d77c1c901d10df1df679e9aa4f310", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "a09827b4-653e-41ab-a2c8-ac7335eb5d54", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc6acae3efb0b5ab635da484a2e29eba8875fac9d6a0d05f40b45272a951a21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "7364d0b4-20ae-4db3-954a-31b6ee2257c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d568775e181f6254688e886e8401190227a02c628806a1cc48737484d435b67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "a7fcb25b-4e67-4a68-a9e5-0ef4afbb9107", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "655b47aec5b67a1263ae07725b80325c137c73d1194a61dd5d7da255d5617060", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "c2d1102a-968c-4351-812f-c7e7c9ce343f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc01d011be9392bb65a4d4ff36d542130afb1ee1c4307c5e70f01839cec62dea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "CHAPTER 2  HEALTH FINANCING MO DELS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES \n28 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Example \nEnrolment in the health insurance system is compulsory in Japan and applies to \nall residents including foreigners (short-period visitors are excluded).

About 67% of the population in Chile is enrolled with Fonasa, while 20% are covered under some 40,000 private plans with 18 licensed Isapres. Thus, the healthcare system in Chile is working on dual structure, both public and private sector working for healthcare services but on different principles.   \nBoth schemes are regulated by the Superintendence of Isapres, under the \nMinistry of Health (Government of Chile). Fonasa is funded to the tune of 50 per \ncent by general tax revenues of the government, while the remaining financing \noccurs through the mandatory contribution by employees and retired people. Substantial out-of-pocket payments are, however, common, despite the high wage contribution by the employees.  \n                                             \n21 Rao KS. Health Insurance in India.

Health financing system in India and its problems \nIn the last learning outcome, we discussed about the health financing system in various countries. We will now discuss about the health financing system in our country.\n1. Health financing system in India \nThe sources of health financing in India are almost same as indicated in the \nglobal picture above. The tax-based public health system has already been discussed in the previous chapter. We have also discussed about the various forms of employment-based health coverage that already exist in India, which \ninclude: \na) The widely recognized Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIS) for \nemployees in the formal sector,  \nb) The Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) for serving and retired civil \nservants,\nc) The schemes for serving and retired employees of the Armed Forces, \nRailways, Paramilitary forces and other Government organizations, and \nd) The various health coverage schemes and benefits provided by banks, \ninsurers, other public sector companies and the private sector employers\n26.\n2. Public expenditure on health in India  Out of the total health expenditure in the country, the share of public or \nGovernment spending, i.e. that of Central, State and Local Governments taken \ntogether, is about one-fifth of the total health expenditure (NHA Cell, 2009).  \nAs a result of this, Indian population is mostly dependent upon the privatised \nhealthcare system. In India, the private healthcare expenditure amounts to around 72% and the public expenditure is around 26% of the total healthcare expenditure.   \n                                             \n26 M a h a l  A ,  S a k t h i v e l  S ,  N a g p a l  S .

At about 1% of the GDP, India\u2019s public health spending appears poorly funded in comparison with countries like China, Sri Lanka and \nThailand, for which this proportion was 1.95%, 1.8% and 3.06% respectively. \n3. National rural health mission \nOne of the most significant developments in the public health financing system \nof the country in recent years has been the introduction of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). This scheme aims to reduce the gap between the healthcare available in urban areas and rural areas. \nNRHM bought additional money for the health sector with the help of several \nhealth financing innovations like 'untied funds'. These untied funds enabled the \navailability and access of quality healthcare system to all people, especially \nwho are residing in rural areas.  \nThese funds provide resources to health facilities and community level bodies \nwithout earmarking to line items. They can spend these funds, within the guidelines of the program on virtually any area where the facility requires. NRHM also attempted integration of the vertical disease control programs under \na single umbrella.  \nExample \nNRHM has strengthened the infrastructure of public health facilities in rural \nareas in terms of equipment, structure and human resources. The other key focus area of the mission wa s delegating the powers to the facilities to hire \nspecialist doctors on contract basis. NRHM also introduced a grassroots level link worker in villages, the ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) worker, who is a volunteer from the community, trained by the public health system and act as a \nlink of the community with the public health system. \n4.

In the urban areas, though private providers are available in plenty, but there also they continue to be poorly regulated for pricing and quality, despite a multitude of legislations having been enacted for the health sector.  \nThe absence of any significant influence from large organized purchasers of \nhealthcare (like insurance mechanisms or the government itself) has also \ncontributed to the situation where there is virtually no check on what a provider can charge for healthcare services, and often no check even on the quality of services rendered. \n5. Need for financial protection and advantages of health insurance \nmechanisms  \nWhile  is a substantial awareness of health insurance being a mechanism for \nfinancial protection of the members to meet costs of their healthcare, but it is important to remember that health insurance also has the potential to influence healthcare provider behaviour. We have earlier discussed about supply side and demand side moral hazards.   \nHealth insurance itself contributes to this risk by providing increased access to \nhealthcare system to many people, who would otherwise be not able to afford \nsuch healthcare by overcoming the cost barrier.  \nMoreover, health insurance schemes can have a negotiating power by acting as a \nlarge purchaser of healthcare facilities, something which an individual without insurance otherwise cannot achieve.  \nHowever, poorly designed health insurance system can influence the healthcare \nproviders pushing up the costs. . This will result in reduced access to the \nhealthcare for the uninsured people and thus, has implications on the \naccessibility, costs and quality of healthcare. \nTest Yourself 3\nHow much is the share of government spending on the total health expenditure in our country?  \nI.

By the end of \n2009, there were over 30 insurers (including non-life insurers, standalone health \ninsurers and life insurers) which were together offering more than 300 different \nproducts, though most of them being hospitalisation indemnity procedures. But \nwith increasing competition in the market, insurers are now coming up with a \nnew variety of coverage of items and innovative products to fulfill the needs of \nvarious sections of the population.  \nMore and more people are now looking for and opting for health insurance \nproducts to secure themselves against the skyrocketing medical costs. In order \nto make health insurance products affordable, insurers are also innovating and \nfocusing on new cost sharing techniques. But at the same time, with lots of \nproducts coming in the market, it is confusing for an individual to select a \nhealth insurance policy which will cater best to his/her medical requirements.  \nThis chapter will discuss the characteristics of various health insurance products \navailable in the Indian market.  \nA. Attributes of Indian health insurance products \n1. Health insurance products in India  \nGeneral Insurance Corporation of India, which comprised of four public sector \ninsurance companies, was initially the largest public sector organisation that offered health insurance products in India. Later in 2001, the health insurance sector was opened up for the private sector  players, which led to many more  \ncompanies entering  the health insurance market, and all of them introduced  \nconsiderable  innovations in their offerings. \nWe will now discuss some of the health insurance product types now available in \nIndia are discussed in this chapter..

Hospitalisation indemnity products \nMediclaim was the first standardised health insurance product that was \nlaunched in the Indian market to provide coverage for hospitalisation expenses up to a pre-defined annual limit of indemnity.

This may be compared with the insurance coverage on benefit basis, where the amount that will be paid on the occurrence of a certain event (like hospitalisation, diagnosis \nof critical illness or each day of admission) is predetermined in the insurance \npolicy and is not related to the actual expenditure incurred. Thus, it covers the hospitalisation expenses for an individual up to the sum assured. \nExample \nRaghu has a small family consisting of his wife and a 14 year old son. He has taken three Mediclaim policies, one for each member of his family, from a health insurance company for an individual cover of Rs. 1 lakh each. All the three policies are independent, and all of them could get recovery of medical expenses up to Rs. 1 lakh in case of hospitalisation.  \nRaghu was hospitalised due to heart attack and required surgery.

The policy had a list of network hospitals mentioned in it, which states that if the insured visits any of the in-network hospitals, it will \ncover 90% of the expenses on occurrence of the event and 10% will be his co-\npay, i.e. he will have to pay 10% from his own pocket. However, if he visits a hospital which is out-of-network, then the insurance company will pay only 80% of the expenses and the insured will have to pay the remaining 20% from his pocket.\nMoreover, there was another clause in the policy stating that in case of any \nhospitalisation, the company will cover room charges only up to 1% of the sum \nassured for a day. It means that the insurance company will pay room charges \nonly up to Rs 2000 a day (i.e. 10% of the sum assured of Rs 2 lakhs) in the event of hospitalisation.  \nThese are examples of cost sharing mechanisms used by insurance companies. \n3.

One of his friends, Rahul, asked him if he had taken any personal accident policy. Vijay asked why he needs such a policy when he already has a life insurance policy with sufficient cover. Rahul advised him that with the increasing number of vehicles in the city, the \naccidents are also increasing, which has obviously increased this risk. \nRahul explained that a health insurance policy will cover the cost incurred in \ncase of hospitalisation, and a life insurance policy will cover the risk associated with death. But if a person dies in an accident, the dependents of the insured will get a lump sum payment from the personal accident policy, along with the life insurance assured sum. This policy is more relevant where the accident results in permanent or temporary disability to the insured. In such cases, it not \nonly covers the risk related to the partial or total disablement by providing \nlump sum payment, but also provides weekly compensation in some cases.  \nThe premium for such policies is quite low. This convinced Vijay, and he \ndecided to take a personal accident policy for himself as soon as possible. \n4. Critical illness \nDreaded diseases like cancer, heart attack, coma or major organ failure may be \nquite infrequent, but are associated with extremely high costs of healthcare. \nMoreover, such costs include a substantial component that may not be covered \nunder the hospitalisation indemnity products. This could be because of exceeding of the sum insured due to the very high costs involved, or high outpatient (ambulatory) expenditure not covered under hospitalisation insurance etc. There could also be need for additional expenses like long term nursing care or home-based nursing.  \nSuch expenses can be financially devastating for the household where the \ncritical illness occurs.

This product also provides an opportunity to avail tax advantages.  \nLife insurers have also recently launched products with Health Savings \ncomponents, and this may increase in popularity in due course. Under these plans, a portion of the premium collected is used for risk coverage or for meeting claims and the unutilised portion of the premium, which is not used, does not lapse, but is accumulated as savings. These savings could be a solution for the challenges faced by senior citizens later in obtaining affordable health insurance.  \nIn practice, HSAs are usually combined with a high-deductible or catastrophic \nhealth insurance. HSAs can meet costs of frequent, low-cost episodes of illnesses (like outpatient consultations, diagnostics and medicines, or low-cost \nhospitalisation).

This process of balancing is done by the underwriter, in accordance with the philosophy, policies and risk appetite of the insurance company concerned.

This classification is normally done through the standard morbidity charts whereby every represented risk is quantified and \npremiums are calculated accordingly. \nFurther, unlike clinical protocols, the insurance risk assessment is based on \nprognosis. Hence based on the type of coverage,   the classification is accordingly done. As we are aware mortality usually comes much after \nmorbidity does. Hence, it is quite logical that the underwriting norms and \nguidelines are much tighter for morbidity coverage than mortality. Therefore, the morbidity premiums are usually steeper than mortality premiums and can increase multifold based on the degree of risk.    \n\nCHAPTER 4  WHAT IS UNDERWRITING? \n56 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Example \nAn individual who is diabetic has a far higher chance of developing a cardiac or \nsystemic complication requiring hospitalisation than of death, and also health episodes can happen multiple times during the course of insurance coverage. A life insurance underwriting guideline might rate this individual as an average cost risk.  However, for medical underwriting, he would be rated higher. \nTherefore, the morbidity premiums will be high and can increase multifold \nbased on the degree of risk. \nIn health insurance, there is a higher focus on medical or health findings than \nfinancial underwriting. However, the latter cannot be ignored as there has to be \nan insurable interest and financial underwriting is important to rule out any adverse selection and ensure persistency in health insurance. \n4. Factors which affect morbidity  The factors which affect morbidity (risk of falling ill) and should be considered \ncarefully while assessing risk are as follows: \na) Age: The premiums are charged commensurate with age and the degree \nof risk. For e.g. the morbidity premiums for infants and children are higher than young adults due to increased risk of infections and accidents. Similarly, for adults beyond the age of 45 years, the premiums are steeper, as the probability of an individual suffering from a chronic ailment like diabetes, a sudden heart ailment or other such morbidity is much higher. \nb) Gender: Women are exposed to additional risk of morbidity during child \nbearing period.", "start_char_idx": 2017, "end_char_idx": 4434, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "184c3d61-0f76-4973-8f8d-4a5c61c55c7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "184c3d61-0f76-4973-8f8d-4a5c61c55c7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c95dbbb0-06f6-4091-952d-65841c753618", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9cb4d790bdfa02983d64b15cf078d20887a8edf05a812bbd5418f40d9846d4c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ade87970-b0d3-4e57-98ad-17dc8e9ac135", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c99f719a410b8550ae0f195dc8bfdd253283423d3b9fec9d8b239e3e5578dc6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b333db18-ff0c-4ebd-99ad-20a37718f58a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea43e4c0f956ce8e191ccc193e4e57412ce8d2a02b400d94460cf9a18c934df8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "c95dbbb0-06f6-4091-952d-65841c753618", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9cb4d790bdfa02983d64b15cf078d20887a8edf05a812bbd5418f40d9846d4c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "f0b6da60-96de-4249-9dd7-7c7aa70deddb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f553fc0fb02537cd3c33d727000c159fd53009bbb5c4e93b45387e91a829cbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "f0ecde84-4143-44b7-a766-708e668a6461", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f58aae4a50f2e8e9b9261f5545dbd427a4dc761d9a820018a935742a6e5b492f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "09fcd64b-a73b-4356-bb3a-c534cda73f7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "452767ab784b70ccf396f0bb2670e8dce3e9bc86476745cf2378cb484d92b753", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "cef97fcf-95cc-42bf-95f6-7281eb2c9d78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b27075dc7da27dc072a6dd908f6f7c57b2e8260d30c40eaec013a15b938928c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "0e839384-6c24-45bd-858b-db53ce3b51c2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "29aee99d5ac60761c65848cdbe3d93ec60545a61a4ddde48b148e0c8c2015086", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "b) Gender: Women are exposed to additional risk of morbidity during child \nbearing period.\nc) Habits: Consumption of tobacco, alcohol or narcotics in any form has a \ndirect bearing on the morbidity risk.\nd) Occupation: Extra risk to accidents is possible in certain occupations, \ne.g. driver, blaster, aviator etc. Likewise, certain occupations may have \nhigher health risks, like an X-Ray machine operator, asbestos industry workers, miners etc. \ne) Family history: This has greater relevance, as genetic pre-disposition \n(e.g. asthma, diabetes, certain cancers etc.) does impact the morbidity and should be taken into consideration while accepting risk. \nf) Build:  Stout, thin or average may also be associated with morbidity in \ncertain groups. \n\nBASIC PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS FOR UNDERWRITING  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  57g) Past illness or surgery: It has to be ascertained whether the past illness \nhas any possibility of causing increased debility or impairment and accordingly the policy terms should be decided.

The objective of the insurance is to compensate the insured by placing him in the same financial position after the loss where he was earlier; insurer pays nothing more and nothing less. The insured cannot expect to get anything more than the loss he has actually suffered. He cannot make a profit out of the insurance contract. In contrast, life and personal accident insurances are not contracts of indemnity but benefit policies. In a benefit policy, the sum insured for \nthe possible occurrence is paid no matter what is actually spent.  \nHowever, in an indemnity policy, one is usually compensated for the actual \ncosts or losses, only to the extent of the sum insured. Therefore under the indemnity principle, the occurrence of the insured event does not entitle the insured to compensation unless the insured suffers a monetary loss.  \n\nBASIC PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS FOR UNDERWRITING  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  59Indemnity in all cases will moreover, be limited by: \ni.

Medical underwriting \nMedical underwriting is a process which is used by the insurance companies to \ndetermine the health status of an individual applying for health insurance policy. This health information collected is then evaluated by the insurers to determine whether to offer coverage, up to what limit and on what conditions and exclusions. Thus medical underwriting can determine the acceptance or \ndeclining of a risk and also the terms of cover.  \nHowever, medical underwriting involves high costs in terms of receiving and \nexamining medical reports.

Also current health status, personal and family medical history enable an underwriter to determine presence of any pre-existing diseases or conditions and eventually the probability of future health problems that may require hospitalisation or surgical intervention. \nFurther proposal forms are designed in a manner to elicit information about \npast treatments taken, hospitalisations and surgical interventions undergone, \nwhich help an underwriter to evaluate the possibility of recurrence of an earlier \nailment, its impact on current or future health status or future complications. Some diseases that the proposer may have been medicated for earlier or is on medication presently may lie dormant for a while and recur again.  \n\nUNDERWRITING PROCESS  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  63Example \nMedical conditions like hypertension, overweight/obesity and raised sugar levels \nhave a high probability of future incidences of associated diseases of the heart, kidney and the nervous system. So, these conditions should be carefully \nconsidered while assessing the risk for medical underwriting. \nCurrent health status and age are key underwriting factors for assessment of \ninsurability of an individual for health insurance. Since adverse changes in health status generally occur post 40 years, mainly due to normal ageing process, insurers do not require any medical examination or tests of the \nproposer earlier than the age of 45 years (some insurers could raise this \nrequirement to 50 or 55 years too). Medical underwriting guidelines may also require a signed declaration of the proposer\u2019s health status by his/her family physician.\nIn the Indian health insurance market, the key medical underwriting factor for \nindividual health insurance is the age of the person. Persons above the age of 45-50 years, enrolling for the first time are normally required to undergo \nspecified pathological investigations to assess health risk profile and to obtain \ninformation on their current health status.

Non-medical underwriting\nMost of the proposers which apply for health insurance do not need medical \nexamination. If it could be known with a fair degree of accuracy that only one-tenth or less of such cases will bring the adverse results during medical examination, insurers could dispense with medical examination in majority of the cases. Even, if the proposer was to disclose all material facts completely \nand truthfully and the same were checked by agent carefully, then also the \nneed for medical examination could have been much less. In fact, a slight increase in the claims ratio can well be compensated for by the savings in the costs of medical underwriting and other procuring expenses due to the increased inconvenience in completing the proposal forms.  \n\nCHAPTER 4  UNDERWRITING PROCESS \n64 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Therefore, insurance companies are coming up with some medical policies \nwhere the proposer is not required to undergo any medical examination. In such cases, companies usually create a \u2018medical grid\u2019 to indicate at what age and stage should a medical underwriting be done, and therefore these non- medical \nlimits are carefully designed so as to strike an appropriate balance between \nbusiness and risk. \nExample \nIf an individual has to take health insurance coverage quickly without going through a long process of medical examinations, waiting periods and processing delays, then he can opt for a non-medical underwriting policy. In a non-medical underwriting policy, premium rates and sum assured are usually decided on the basis of answers to a few health questions mostly based on age, gender, smoking class, build etc. The process is speedy but the premiums are relatively \nhigher.\n3. Numerical rating method   \nThis is a process adopted in underwriting, wherein numerical or percentage \nassessments are made on each component of the risk.  \nFactors like age, sex, race, occupation, residence, environment, built, habits, \nfamily and personal history are examined and scored numerically based on pre-determined criteria. The facts are not easy to ascertain and prejudice may color \nthe reports. Nevertheless, the basis of the numerical system is logical; it gives a \ndebit or a minus score to the unfavorable aspects of the risk, and gives a credit to the favorable ones.

In such instances a supplementary debit for association is added or the combination is treated as a unit and conjoined debit applied according to known experience. \nExample \nIn a numerical rating method, an applicant is assumed to start at a point of 100, i.e. 100% of the standard risk. Then, according to his built, family history, occupation, habits and other related factors, points are assigned to each factor \non the basis of rating manual. If the applicant is suffering from any disease such \nas diabetes or high blood pressure, he will get debit points for example 25 points, which will be added to his standard risk. Similarly, if the applicant has an occupation which is safe for any major health risks such as a professor in university or a doctor, then he will get some credit points for it, for example 5 points which will be deducted from his standard risk.  \n\nUNDERWRITING PROCESS  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  65After considering all the factors, all debits and credits are added or subtracted \nto reach the final rating.

Thus, while accepting a group for health insurance, the insurers take into consideration the existence of a few members in the group who may have severe and frequent health problems. Hence, excepting for group \ncover, if such individuals having severe and frequent health problems were to \nbe underwritten on an individual basis, they would be construed either substandard or uninsurable risks. \nUnderwriting of group health insurance requires analysing the characteristics of \nthe group to evaluate its conformance with the insurance company\u2019s underwriting guidelines as well as the guidelines laid down for group insurance by the insurance regulators.", "start_char_idx": 4706, "end_char_idx": 6611, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8ad7ad5-2839-4ee1-abef-66ece989efc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8ad7ad5-2839-4ee1-abef-66ece989efc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ea0d26c-48b7-43c6-807e-b2191db36904", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0b201e7ef30ab3ff8ba9cb47e53481b734c6c6c0171d52a40dab6b3e6371fa2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "23f3237a-2556-4cc0-b429-258aac57db2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d5848a59d5c9428872dd3b6c0c9fb916c54a07b7cad15c9ad447f24dff639c5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30f3cacc-5400-44b6-bb79-fd02f626dffa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1112df5f83cc125ef9b490306a145ca4bde7f5a635723952de01fb08f79d5fce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "4ea0d26c-48b7-43c6-807e-b2191db36904", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0b201e7ef30ab3ff8ba9cb47e53481b734c6c6c0171d52a40dab6b3e6371fa2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "4a36d7c8-9e43-4d28-8d96-b0605ec8c11f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b526b5a3f0485237ca55bf5e41b0cd1c422726d0dea9ba859c22a8e612d1a87", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "154c32c2-61a1-49e9-aa6f-cc96acfad3f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c2a53865fec696ef4aad815ac922e2c1d5b9ba6876c5790017181fc0b02bd39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "35e42d0c-4bc7-4bf2-b125-6e20c634533b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dea28022251ea02b1e61a4887be478bc758a5097877db540753c6a4d4a90c625", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "8fda11c8-83f3-4de2-a937-5834ae5a0782", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5018409c69a797a9fd9161d0f6b44f695ff676f77cfdcbd7479465a9590ee75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "de634926-20c6-487c-9800-376cd48fe911", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "03ee4ba7fa3e10c75d093876e46b48919a310c7323f49af2cdee86ff680f54d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Standard underwriting process for group health insurance requires evaluating \nthe proposed group on the following parameters: \na) Type of group \nb) Group size  \nc) Type of industry \nd) Eligible lives for coverage e) Whether entire group is being covered or there is an option for members \nto opt-out \nf) Level of coverage \u2013 whether uniform or stratified \ng) Composition of the group in terms of sex, age, single or multisite \nlocations, income levels of group members, employee turnover rate, whether premium paid entirely by the group holder or members are required to participate in premium payment \nh) Difference in healthcare costs across regions in case of multi-site \nlocations spread in different geographical locations \ni) Determining preference of the group holder for administration of the \ngroup insurance by a third party administrator (of his choice or one \nselected by the insurer) or by the insurer itself \nj) Past claims experience of the proposed group \n\nGROUP HEALTH INSURANCE  CHAPTER 4 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  71Example \nA group of members working in mines or factories is at higher health risk than a \ngroup of members working in air-conditioned offices.

Therefore, the insurer will price the group health insurance policy accordingly in both the cases.  \nSimilarly to avoid adverse selection in case of groups with high turnover such as \nIT companies, insurers can introduce precautionary criteria requiring employees \nto serve their probationary period before becoming eligible for insurance. \nDue to highly competitive nature of group health insurance business, insurers \nallow substantial flexibility and customisation in benefit designing of the group insurance plans.

Such non-employer groups \ninclude: \na) Employer welfare associations \nb) Holders of credit cards issued by a specific company c) Customers of a particular business where insurance is offered as an add-\non benefit \nd) Borrowers of a bank and professional associations or societies \nThe rationale of the group insurance guidelines is to restrict formation of groups \nfor the sole purpose of availing insurance with advantage of  of flexible design, coverage of benefits not available on individual policies and cost savings. It has been observed that such \u2018groups of convenience\u2019 have often led to adverse selection against the insurers and eventually high claim ratios. Group insurance guidelines by the regulatory authority, thus, help in responsible market conduct by the insurers not only in instilling underwriting discipline but also in canvassing group insurance schemes and setting up administration standards for \ngroup schemes. \n3. Use of genetics in underwriting \nThis is a controversial application of the science of Genetics, but underwriters \nof the future may be able to study the genetic information of individuals for health risk assessment. Human DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid), is the \u2018blueprint of life\u2019, which contains the genetic instructions used in the development and \nfunctioning of living organisms, provides an innovative and effective tool to \nunderwriters and actuaries in assessment of the health status of an individual.  \nGenetic abnormalities can be broadly classified as inherited or acquired \n(resulting from mutations caused by aging or the environment).

The word contract is derived from the word \u2018Contrahere\u2019- which means \n\u2018to draw together\u2019 and it stresses the importance of mutuality in the use of the \nparticle or subject, more than the word \u2018Agreement\u2019.  That\u2019s why insurance policies are popularly known as insurance contracts rather than insurance agreements wherein the mutuality of both the parties are stressed based on the principles of \u2018Uberima Fides\u2019 viz.

It has all the mandatory elements of a contract.\na) Offer and acceptance:  Health insurance policies offer the benefits of \nproviding coverage in the event of hospitalisation/ illness for a premium that is required to be paid by the customer. \nb) Consideration:  The extent of premium is determined by the inputs & \ndeclarations provided by the customer about their age, health status etc. \nc) Capacity of contract:  Both the parties, insurer and insured should be \nlegally capable of entering into a health insurance contract.", "start_char_idx": 2123, "end_char_idx": 4475, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93db6cc4-d698-4a35-9104-ecee4ae7247e": {"__data__": {"id_": "93db6cc4-d698-4a35-9104-ecee4ae7247e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cfb67ee2-77e0-47a6-affd-c7faf8d2c2db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51be7778c5699c97a68479281c332945e56948e8057128da1c07faa1ba5c2970", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02d5507c-4785-4567-9146-281e7ff086bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "84269056f4fe804cc9bbff4a8068e87e8fd97a94b1ceed7d7766a2e7f5e29951", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41f4ecc2-348a-4443-94af-1c3f1cc56d1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3076431338a01067bc312f33cba985da3d9eb26f49b1c553c14d47d88fe5159d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "cfb67ee2-77e0-47a6-affd-c7faf8d2c2db", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51be7778c5699c97a68479281c332945e56948e8057128da1c07faa1ba5c2970", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "2f75cb4a-ba42-4368-a720-c1904d83952d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8a5f9352415b6981dee1a65ef7509d252407c4877644098023898e7275957cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "1abdbb01-4c7c-42bc-8fa1-d4473e356afd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df06badf517fe9e73a34617e11bc4b4a26837fc0f5d68bb22f643182341c5c21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "ddbc69d3-c153-4fda-a18c-0995b3f8e702", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e67f6923180d3fa0b615b6d347febadf94fd8a92c1f90766f824c940c016964", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "ca12d200-db65-4a99-920c-89101ad4aa2c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04fee5a3ff42baf91180196a6567402ecc897f66bc95ac9704d9d65870cb0cb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "564bf81b-3890-497e-a8d5-fc0966ced5e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "70698416e2a39060ee5348f48fd144289792fffef67916c57bb7f2c623193630", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "d) Legality of form:  When a customer buys a health insurance policy; it means \nthat he is signing a contract with the insur ance company to cover his illness \nbased on a mutual consent. \nThe mutual consent comes in the form of the proposal by the customer and its \nacceptance by the insurer. \n2. Insurance contract vs. other contracts  \nOne may wonder why in the case of insurance, the customer normally does not \nhave much say other than accepting most of the conditions of the product. \nSometimes the conditions are written in difficult legal language that it may be very difficult for a person to understand as well.  As insurers cover the risk based on the laws of probability, law of large numbers and other principles of insurance, the insurance company contracts are slightly different from the other contracts.\n\nCHAPTER 5  HEALTH INSURANCE CONTRACT \n82 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE In general, insurance contracts are different from the other contracts through \nthe following ways: \na) Unlike other contracts, the customer may never see the copy of the \ncontract till he receives the policy (though ideally it should not differ \nmuch from the content of the prospectus which the customer should see beforehand). \nb) While in other forms of contracts, the buyer should beware \u2018caveat \nemptor\u2019; however this rule stands modified in insurance contracts by the principle of \u2018utmost good faith\u2019 from both the sides. \nDiagram 2: Insurance contract Vs.

The underlying principle is that the data becomes more vital in case of health insurance as it forms part \nof the underwriting process and also the \u2018insurance contract\u2019 wherein in other \ncases; it is just a requirement to register the details of the customer under Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.   \nA person is likely to know more things about himself when compared to others, \nwhich is part of the information asymmetry of health insurance from the insured\u2019s side.

Recently, some life insurance companies have launched Unit Linked \nHealth Insurance plans. In this plan, the total premium is split up into risk \npremium and investment amount. While the risk premium is allocated for the health insurance coverage, the investment amount is diverted to the unit linked funds which can pay for the future health costs or for the costs like OPD not covered in the risk component. The products may also offer other benefits like hospitalisation allowances, critical illness benefits etc.  \nInternationally, there are products called as Health Savings Account (HSA) which \naccumulate an amount to be utilised when the account holder needs to spend \non health care, i.e. usually at the senior age. These products encourage savings for expected high costs of medical care in the future. Individuals are personally conscious of costs so help reduce moral hazard and may mobilise greater funds for health. \nHowever, savings alone are generally not high enough to protect a person from \nunexpectedly high cost diseases or chronic conditions. To avoid this, HSA\u2019s are \noften offered together with a catastrophic health insurance plan to cover rare \nbut high cost events.\n7.

In contributory schemes, the beneficiaries (employees or members) also contribute to the premium and in non-contributory schemes, only the employer or the affinity organisation contributes to the premium.

For example, the group policies may cover maternity and pre-existing diseases \nfrom day one. \nb)Premium\nThe premium for the individual products can vary from the group insurance.  \nDuring the tariff era, where premium for fire and engineering insurance was fixed by tariff, insurance companies experienced very low claims ratio in fire portfolio and used to cross-subsidise the group health insurance premium as a marketing strategy for fire business.

The TPAs will validate the incidence reported by the claimant and after satisfaction, will issue a pre-authorisation letter to the \nhospital guaranteeing the payment. The TPA may not necessarily approve all the \nclaims and may require more information or documents. Denial of cashless does not affect the admissibility of claims and the customers can submit the claim papers later to the insurer/TPA for reimbursement. \n6. Deductible\nDeductibles are a cost sharing mechanism. These are the initial amount of an \nadmissible claim which must be first borne by the insured before the insurer \nstarts paying for the claim. \nExample \nGirish has taken a health insurance policy which had a clause for deductible of Rs.10,000. This clause means that the first Rs.10,000 of every admissible claim will have to be borne by Girish and excess, if any will be paid by the insurance company. For example, if Girish has incurred hospitalisation expenses of Rs.25,000, then he will have to pay first Rs.10,000 from his own pocket as \ndeductible and then the insurance company will pay excess sum of Rs.15,000.  \n7.

It \nmeans that the insurance company will not bear the entire expenses. Vikas will have to pay Rs.20 from his own pocket for every Rs.100 claimed. Therefore, if Vikas will incur hospitalisation expenses of Rs.15,000, then he will have to pay 20% of it, i.e.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2191, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3cf6d448-cee8-4a4c-9fc8-6f7c230ce3de": {"__data__": {"id_": "3cf6d448-cee8-4a4c-9fc8-6f7c230ce3de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ea29a93-2dbf-49e2-9e12-663a147ca765", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f0c7d01354195a20259b6f7dbeaf6b5cd2ee249c37927f35ba7d13322eabd04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d85de2f-81eb-4766-b784-59574c0e943a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c1ce561333bed494d489d5d54d90c208a7adbb2ce487641120159480b63185c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7fe67b38-bd83-4713-b139-15f54a5d43b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d59d6382d2ba3558e2874ea7fa365857389f56bf1e33ad300b44123575da37e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "4ea29a93-2dbf-49e2-9e12-663a147ca765", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f0c7d01354195a20259b6f7dbeaf6b5cd2ee249c37927f35ba7d13322eabd04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "732fd6e0-786c-4a96-a68c-64f7f1a522c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7596c72273bf7b2af5ca7116b2c1315d8bae0cdbd4efa63fb480db30fbf3d82f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "be6b8130-098b-42dd-9457-696a60961342", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "401859788579ae8f28f10480957ca178b1fc9a1a49bec61c51486cb9ca947a6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "9320eea5-5caa-472a-a605-656dad8294e4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6af43ef32dac138c1cb8ce2a8cd35d794d5af5bf1fcaaf7b9b309f15aa9656ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "6b494ddb-e489-44d7-bf6a-4d3ccc277a98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b01491f67b0cd52587a2a010b8067db3c944147ee39316f869463698c0b83b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "32ed441d-49d8-4e9d-b15f-3c47e0cdcae0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0c4c13048e78bb6b6cdd4ca7e581ec4783eed3900f36d7b7f77c7798dbe134e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Rs.3,000 from his own pocket and the insurance company will pay \nhis share of 80%, i.e. remaining expenses of Rs.12,000. \n\nCOMMON CLAUSES IN ALL HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS  CHAPTER 5 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  998. Waiting period \nThe initial period within which any claims made will not be entertained. \nNormally, all the new policies come with a minimum 30 days waiting period \nwherein the insured person cannot make a claim for the diseases contracted \nduring the first 30 days. This is to avoid someone taking a policy in order to get a hospitalisation claim immediately after pur chase of the policy. The waiting \nperiod does not usually apply to accidental injuries, or to renewals of policies.  \n9. Pre-existing illness \nThis gains importance in the light of the exclusion to the policy that is \napplicable for the pre-existing illnesses. This has been the subject of many legal \ninterpretations, a lot of consumer grievances and considerable media attention. In recent years, subsequent to a consensus of the General Insurance Council, insurance companies have started covering pre-existing illness after the completion of 4 policy years.  An insurance company may choose to reduce 4 year period but cannot increase the same.. \nExample \nLisa, aged 40 years is working as a financial consultant. She is a patient of high blood pressure and takes regular medication for it. She decided to purchase a \nhealth insurance policy for herself. After lots of research, she settled for a \nhealth insurance plan with a clause for an exclusion period of 12 months for his pre-existing disease of high BP. During the first year of her policy, no claims related to high BP were entertained. However, her other claims during the period which were not related to pre-existing diseases such as hospitalisation \ndue to malaria and other diagnosis tests were covered.  \n10.  Exclusions \nThe insurance company normally indicates various scenarios that cannot be \nentertained for claim payments. The rationale behind is to avoid staged or fraudulent claims, misuse insurance for profit motive and to keep costs of \nclaims low, and thus controls insurance premium costs. However, customers \nusually do not fully understand the excluded conditions and this could be a trust issue between the customer and the insurer.", "start_char_idx": 2192, "end_char_idx": 4491, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fe67b38-bd83-4713-b139-15f54a5d43b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fe67b38-bd83-4713-b139-15f54a5d43b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ea29a93-2dbf-49e2-9e12-663a147ca765", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f0c7d01354195a20259b6f7dbeaf6b5cd2ee249c37927f35ba7d13322eabd04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3cf6d448-cee8-4a4c-9fc8-6f7c230ce3de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4849b83fb15f53c4b6c2b41985c7cb9d1b8bb6b3f5861273d61fc0e08f4e7914", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6e91c54-b706-451f-b456-40b91bcf297f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9cfd23e23233cbcb3c0db2437f709cf068339b2d3a6934dcc301b84ccf47a94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "4ea29a93-2dbf-49e2-9e12-663a147ca765", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f0c7d01354195a20259b6f7dbeaf6b5cd2ee249c37927f35ba7d13322eabd04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "a40a4a02-ee04-4e8f-b61a-47739c54a5ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e241bcdabd858d9d5b8ef7b16f790b658f5776197dab7f0a6fc54f7d93ea4644", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "353497a7-4c7d-4040-b9cf-29da9d798fbc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "51dd41e86e78452c09c858acd4987a79b81ee76424b745424dab956b4d1b4898", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "5e892416-af5a-485d-8ab6-83a1901744c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "899434594bed1b809733c67936a3cb2e56b6a678eb5e02c79440a715682b4db9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "d28bbf0c-0aa3-4cf4-bb98-fb5d9af82ae5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e48cec7127f19c19e9ccdab325474fc12ffd930f024f9e026abb5d23a39a68a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "1879eca8-ee66-4db8-b988-1dda0af934d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4611ada799df9b6736a13f9ef351a09cfc17e2daf297d9b260c5ce7120ed0cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "CHAPTER 5  COMMON CLAUSES IN ALL HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS \n100 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Some of the common exclusions (list is indicative and not exhaustive) are: \na) Pre-existing illness \nb) Diseases contracted during initial waiting period \nc) Expenses on treatment of specific ailments for a specific period like \nhernia, fistula, and cataract etc. (which are covered after the waiting period is over) \nd) Injury or disease due to war, wa r like operations and similar scenarios \ne) Cosmetic surgery, plastic surgery \nf) Dental treatment g) Abuse of drugs/alcohol usage \nh) Naturopathy treatment \ni) Non-medical expenses for personal comfort like television, telephone, \ntoiletry items etc. \n11. Cancellation clause Usually, this clause can only be invoked by the insurer for reasons of fraud, \nmoral hazard, misrepresentation or non-cooperation of the insured. Similarly, the customer may also cancel the policy based on the policy conditions and the \ninsurance company is supposed to refund the premium on short-term cover \nscales of the insurer. However the company is liable for any claim, which arose prior to the date of cancellation. \n12. Renewability clause After much discussion in this direction and as required by the regulator, the \nindustry\u2019s stand generally is that the health insurance products will ordinarily \nbe renewable. However, the insurer is not responsible or liable for non-renewal \nof policy due to non-receipt or delayed receipt of the renewal notice to the insured. Also, the company may revise the premium rates, terms and conditions of the policy at the time of renewal.

Lack of standard definitions also means that products are difficult to compare, and the availability of standard definitions thus can ensure better comparability and uniformity in the understanding of health insurance products. \nb) Standardisation of forms \nThe majority of the insurers and TPAs require mostly the same information \nin their pre-authorisation and cla ims forms. However, each of them uses \ndifferent formats and this means that a typical hospital would be expected to keep stock of 30 or 40 different forms and understand them well. If the forms would be standardised, they will be better understood, more complete and more accurate. This was therefore taken up by the multi-stakeholder working groups to develop and suggest to the industry for \nstandardisation of forms for pre-authorisation and claims which could be \nused by all insurers and TPAs.   \nc) Standardisation initiatives on the non-medical expenses \nInsurance companies providing hospitalisation indemnity covers generally \nexclude certain categories of expenses in their policy terms and conditions. However, there is no detailed listing of such excluded expenses, and the \ninterpretation of these exclusions is highly varied across different payers in \nthe industry. There are many cases when various items under the claims filed by hospital providers or individual policyholders are repudiated by the insurers but are disputed by the claimants. This is, thus, one major cause of acrimony between insurance companies & healthcare providers and also causes a lot of confusion in the minds of consumer.

It will also discuss the actuarial role and techniques for pricing and \nreserving in health insurance.  \nLearning Outcomes \nA. Data in health insurance \nB. Collection and analysis of health insurance data \nC. Actuarial function in a health insurance company \n\nCHAPTER 6  DATA IN HEALTH INSURANCE \n114 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE Look at this Scenario \nIn the current market, data is one of the most valuable resources. However, \ndata is not useful unless it can be processed and turned into information that allows a business competitive advantage. Though we have various information systems to collect information, sometimes, it just results in loads of information with no direction. This is because when data is collected, it is usually presented in various forms and formats which makes it out of order. Therefore, we need a proper system to use the data to help us in decision-making, pricing of products, testing various hypotheses and identifying trends and opportunities. \nIn the arena of health insurance, thousands of claims are generated every day, \nincluding hospitals, physicians, and pharmacies.  A number of TPAs process these \nclaims and route them to the appropriate payer. Thus, the TPAs carry huge amounts of data that runs in thousands everyday but other than routing them, no other purpose is served from the data.

Importance of data in health insurance \nThe importance of data of the health insurance industry for various sectors is   \nsummarised below: \na) For insurers \ni. Management : Use data analysis reports generated from the experience \ndata to make informed decisions and take corrective actions related to pricing, product design, business plans, marketing strategy etc.  \nExample \nThe management of an insurance company received an annual report providing data about profitability ratios for their various insurance products. On analysis of that data, the management decided to modify the premium for some products which were giving higher than usual loss ratios within the next three months to achieve the desired profitability or control over losses. On taking this corrective action related to product pricing, they got the desired results in their \nsubsequent annual reports.\nii. Actuaries : Perform most of the rating and underwriting analyses \nincluding experience rating, classification and segmentation analysis and \ninternal tariff development. \niii. Underwriters : Use data to study the pattern indicated by the data to \ndecide the acceptance or denial of a risk. An underwriter also uses data to load premiums or provide discounts for a particular kind of risk.\n  Example \nInsurance underwriting is the process of selection, classification and rating of \nrisks and it cannot be performed effectively without the availability of \nsufficient data.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2312, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d13efce-f3d1-422b-b6ee-1922b1fb735f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d13efce-f3d1-422b-b6ee-1922b1fb735f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a5dfea7-40a3-4348-ad5e-a1062de409f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2150aed1c7e752e7d7eb073ac0618428e602d115dc5930c528305b35e71e58ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ec2fdd4-497c-41fb-ba08-5e22446f313f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3a8408b92fb51837d5f720ecf6e87818400cb50d015e83b258cee6c38be1fef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "62464042-a397-42f1-a19d-95e87cb74836", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "681b36b92bc2534d604d80828ac5ea0bfe4ae1d033d5b3be0f5dd18b9710f80b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "8a5dfea7-40a3-4348-ad5e-a1062de409f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2150aed1c7e752e7d7eb073ac0618428e602d115dc5930c528305b35e71e58ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "412da5f2-f8ee-4182-ba08-884c90b0e037", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5b4ebe0a19f205e2529f79caf7f4502a1334c95c630b75826168eca4e3d4939", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "0263e2d8-282e-4970-887b-8423295c5005", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bda3a8baee28090f0e7e27ffc86f98b483eda790c6b038e1543e9e2c85bac7ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "48c28a92-1292-478b-85c0-00416a494b3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f66201cce894097ab77c0b7512e03de2575d21e487f8823158e8a323b82fc9d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "89ad77a3-0749-4a69-8dec-f8ac2c4bf04d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "786b0bf0dba3f0f534b6521d8b11aa3de70db627ffbd1b33a8a39d17b66c5d6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "bfea1425-fd8a-4b9d-911e-f578bef7754a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e6c3e862c83d9d959ba8c3cffc14df77cc17bc5d8f57c19713b05b620ceeafe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "Underwriters review applications for insurance coverage submitted to the \ncompany.

Collection and analysis of health insurance data \n1. Collection and collation of data in India and the IRDA data repository28\nInsurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) was set up to protect the \ninterests of the policyholders and to regulate, promote and ensure orderly growth of the insurance industry. To accomplish this objective and for the \nefficient functioning of the insurers, it is important that reliable, timely and \naccurate data is collected, processed and disseminated by an independent body. Data is important for any industry and especially for the insurance industry which is essentially data oriented. IRDA, therefore, constituted an Insurance Information Bureau (IIB) in 2009 to provide reliable data on the \nsector to researchers and policy makers. \nBefore the IIB was created by IRDA in 2009, health insurance industry sent the \ndata to the Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC) since the year 2004. Section 64 UE \nof the Insurance Act, 1938, inter-alia authorised TAC to require and collect information etc. The TAC also published a Health Insurance Data Reporting Manual which contained detailed instructions on acceptable data structures to standardise data collection. Data table formats and manual developed by TAC were revised in 2008 and were then adopted by IRDA, which later authorised IIB to perform the function of collecting, collating and disseminating data earlier vested with TAC.  \nExample \nData compilation, storage and analysis in the Indian health insurance sector got a major boost with the introduction of TPAs.

The cost of the product was as low as Rs.10 per member per month in a family. As the company introduces the product for the first time and that too at a very low cost, it was concerned about the results.  \nHowever, the analysis done at the end of the year on written premiums for the \nproduct were quite surprising. The product was able to attract many people in rural areas due to its low cost which resulted in a strong policyholder base and overall profitability. The company therefore, decided to continue the product \nat the same price.  \nb) Earned premium \nThe portion of an insurance written premium which is considered \"earned\" \nby the insurer, based on the ratio of the time elapsed on the policy to its \neffective life.  \nThis analysis can divide the written premium for each of the policy years \ninto two segments: earned premium for the current year and the balance for the remaining period for which the insurance coverage will continue.  \nExample \nKetan has taken a health insurance policy in July 2012 and paid a premium of \nRs.10,000 for two years.

INSURANCE 4. ICD-10 coding system  \nThe international statistical classification of diseases and related health \nproblems (most commonly known by the abbreviation ICD) provides codes to \nclassify diseases and a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, \ncomplaints, social circumstances and external causes of injury or disease. Every health condition can be assigned to a unique category and given a code, up to six characters long. Such categories can include a set of similar diseases. \nThe international classification of diseases is published by the World Health \nOrganisation. The ICD is used world-wide for morbidity and mortality statistics, reimbursement systems and automated decision support in medicine. This \nsystem is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, \nprocessing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. The ICD is a core classification of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC). \nCountries need to adopt and implement this classification so that the morbidity \nand mortality databases are comparable within the various region/states of the country and between countries of the region/world. Such reliable information is essential for meaningful conclusion on the health status of the population and \nfor planning the development of facilities for medical and healthcare and their \nefficient functioning. \nThe ICD is revised periodically and is currently in its tenth edition. Since Indian \nindustry was still in its nascent stage in terms of data collection and analysis when the decision to implement a disease coding system was being formulated around the year 2004, the latest available version was the tenth one (abbreviated as ICD-10) and was considered as the best alternative.  \nIn India, the ICD code is generally assigned at the time of discharge either by \nthe hospital staff or more frequently, by the TPAs at the time of claim processing.", "start_char_idx": 2002, "end_char_idx": 4311, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85293a4a-260f-4914-a40c-b69f40ad396f": {"__data__": {"id_": "85293a4a-260f-4914-a40c-b69f40ad396f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14b3ce89-7963-4a30-bcb0-e0f9f1da0974", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c21da7733925e7922207a9690051d9468f1b633215b3961124d5e3e11230f862", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "19ee688a-a16b-4178-b063-5e670809560a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6dc3c78fc131279dcb534fb35b06202197c8cc679306fdccff1e0c44193ed47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4136caa3-c9a5-49af-b4cd-fcadf82aa6ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "965e87c76e037ad2a166f864ec735e0ec1cada332689931d153b84adfa8023b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "14b3ce89-7963-4a30-bcb0-e0f9f1da0974", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c21da7733925e7922207a9690051d9468f1b633215b3961124d5e3e11230f862", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "6ddf8904-d35c-40fb-8f6b-e87d4b4c8e49", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63dabf4148411abd1bd44e0dff9762eeade250209ae98a70c4938d0c1539d60f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "fac98583-920a-4ab9-99e6-4941d0727f49", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a761f8ee42d8dba974f884a91b960b56a4ccbdf6d0de4eccd91ddea17d633054", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "3078859d-44cf-41ff-8352-957e1b0d6d3e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "10a09a3265b6ebb282056f7c7fc7115fb24120d06055fb2a53e5ffcaa6ff2a94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "e2d35be1-029c-4354-847b-80cc250de5b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d86d5fc31bcc7c7f480ac194c020d0d69c90c026063f2b2d829c575885f6c014", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "ICDs can be used for the following purposes:  \na) For analysis of the general disease profile of population group \nb) For monitoring of the incidence and prevalence of diseases and other \nhealth problems in relation to other variables such as the characteristics and circumstances of the individuals affected \nc) For analysing medical cost and utilisation trends by location and by \nprovider\nd) For analysing impact of seasonality on disease occurrence e) For benefit pricing and negotiating costs.  \nIn addition ICD10 also provides the basis for compilation of national mortality \nand morbidity statistics by WHO member states.

Analysis of expenses  \nii. Analysis of movement of policies such as renewal, cancellations etc \niii. Asset liability modeling \niv. Analysis for modeling customer behaviour such as fraud, renewal etc. \nActuaries, therefore, play an important role in the design of health insurance \nproducts with the help of various data analysis and morbidity tables.  \n1. Actuarial techniques \nActuarial science is a blend of four subjects: statistics, mathematics, finance \nand economics. As the actuary needs to estimate the future likely experience based on the past data, statistical techniques are frequently used for actuarial work. Economics is used to understand the impact of macro-economic factors on the assumptions used such as long term interest rate. Finance and mathematics helps in understanding the corporate governance structure and the financial securities available in the market. \nExample \nNayan purchased a life insurance policy which pays Rs 100,000 to the policy holder at the end of five years in case he is alive at that time. To calculate the premium for such a policy, an actuary will need to estimate the likely cost to the company in present value terms. Using statistics, the actuary would \nestimate the chances of survival till five years and the chances that the policy \nholder will go on paying the premiums for five years (that is, the policy is not lapsed). Using economics, the actuary will decide on the discount rate at which the future payments will be brought to the present value term (which is a \nfinancial mathematics calculation).   \n2.", "start_char_idx": 6409, "end_char_idx": 8712, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c85ba92-7519-4b35-b722-e40837b18a40": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c85ba92-7519-4b35-b722-e40837b18a40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14b3ce89-7963-4a30-bcb0-e0f9f1da0974", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c21da7733925e7922207a9690051d9468f1b633215b3961124d5e3e11230f862", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4136caa3-c9a5-49af-b4cd-fcadf82aa6ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "965e87c76e037ad2a166f864ec735e0ec1cada332689931d153b84adfa8023b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "14b3ce89-7963-4a30-bcb0-e0f9f1da0974", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c21da7733925e7922207a9690051d9468f1b633215b3961124d5e3e11230f862", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "25f2fb22-8d0f-40f4-b028-4803890969ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "620827f80dcb690df9627e9009ea1cd9840cb6b43890b8cb8c4f6c5a8c1ce6cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "31739764-1d19-4962-99d6-9538230bfd25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "283d6dba960294eddae72463d536d01ddb5d2eef55026a5fe5ca8e0a703dc465", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "2. Fundamentals of pricing \nPricing is an exercise to determine the right level of premium so that the \ncompany makes the desired level of profit after paying for the claims and other \nexpenses on a portfolio of policies. So, an analysis needs to be done on the past data to estimate the average claim payment per policy. This analysis of claims data would be done by setting the premiums at the different segment levels such as age, sum insured, geographical area etc. The factors which may impact \nthe premium (e.g. age, sum insured, area) are called the \u2018rating factors\u2019.

Age \nis the most important factor among them. If an applicant is in the age group of 40 to 50 years, then the company will fix a higher pricing for their policy as this age group people are more prone to hypertension, diabetes and heart attacks.  \nSimilarly, location is also important in pricing. For example, the medical \nservices in Delhi will be more expensive than other towns or cities such as Baroda or Nagpur. Therefore, a person staying in Delhi will have to pay higher \npremiums than a person staying in small towns or cities. \nIn group insurance policies, the structure of the group also plays an important \nrole in pricing of the product. The group which employs a lot of older or experienced people will pay higher premiums than a group employing college graduates. Similarly, if the company has more of women employees and that too below the age of 35, the insurance company can price their premiums at a \nhigher rate as it may have to pay more due to maternity and childcare costs. \nThe following are the most important factors to be considered while pricing a \nhealth insurance product: \ni. The cost of paying benefits \nii. The cost of administering the program such as issuing policies, \nadjudicating claims, collecting premiums, filing annual statements, etc.  \niii. The cost of marketing and distributing policies that includes the \ncommissions paid to agents and brokers.  \niv. Companies also need to cover their cost of capital and maintain \nadequate financial reserves in case costs are higher than expected.  \nExample \nAdministrative costs incurred by an insurance company are also one of the major components to be considered in their product pricing. The administrative expenses of an insurance company comprise cost incurred in designing the product, advertisements, marketing, publicity, employee\u2019s monthly salary, \ncommission paid to TPAs and agents and other daily operating expenses. These \ncosts are also recovered from the policyholders in the form of the premium paid \nby them. \nThere may be other considerations involved in pricing apart from the technical \nanalysis such as: \ni.

Claim reserving \nOnce a policy is sold by the insurance company, meeting the future claim \npayments is the company\u2019s \u2018liability\u2019 until the cover is expired. This liability \nneeds to be calculated from time to time for internal management or statutory \nreporting. There are various actuarial methods used for calculating the liabilities or reserving.  \nThe claim management department sets aside a reserve for a claim the moment \nit is reported. The actual claim paid at the time of settlement may be more or less than the reserve. This claim reserving is done for each and every claim on case-by-case basis. \nActuary\u2019s role in the reserving process is to estimate the incurred but not \nreported (IBNR) claim reserves and to estimate the expected additional payments on the claims for which the claim management department has kept the reserves. Actuaries use the reporting delay pattern and the claim settlement pattern to estimate these numbers. \n4. Data and modeling \nNone of the analysis above can be done accurately unless complete and \naccurate data is captured in the company\u2019s database systems. For example to understand that which disease is causing the maximum claims for a company, it needs to capture the disease details of each claim. \nThere are two sets of data used by the actuaries:  \ni. Details of policies and the insured members, and  \nii. Details of the claims.  \nThere should also be a unique key using which each claim can be linked back to \nthe member which gave rise to the claim. \nModeling process is used to analyse the data and come up with a formula which \ncan be used to predict the future with as much accuracy as possible. These \nmodels are simplistic formulae to understand the complex real life behaviours. \nFor example using the data a model can be built which predicts the expected claim amount from a person of age 30, sum insured 200,000 in Mumbai.  \nThere are various kinds of actuarial models available which helps actuaries in \npredicting the future behaviour by analysing past claims.", "start_char_idx": 2354, "end_char_idx": 4706, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "305c7fd8-a135-4d69-91e5-e4d7f9328078": {"__data__": {"id_": "305c7fd8-a135-4d69-91e5-e4d7f9328078", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2105dc0-436e-4d31-9a25-2d54b88a399f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5dc1417095a59a77fb23cf3373e364454a8b38606843a985da3439a2e06322d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "073260f7-127e-4f94-8673-7369f23c7a2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a84beeabac26681e6b05fde7f45e75146f2e88efdd1b0ae132d1b71ef8b533cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b2b9c9b-1c40-4b81-a807-9f6ef65aa318", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee28a6bb7fd8ad03967a60a5a476bb974668049540399ba02ae0d2ecde9f5624", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "b2105dc0-436e-4d31-9a25-2d54b88a399f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5dc1417095a59a77fb23cf3373e364454a8b38606843a985da3439a2e06322d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "c6d90190-87b3-4b32-9fdc-ae8811843433", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2dce6b98658f189bebf9f6d68c77bd8a6bf00df13f11b970c59c207ff37dc863", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "601d863c-c800-487c-a0d6-9e3b85af4caa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "359890c6a9769a9860cdde4671866eb353dd1e772407c62b3098a9319158bafd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "7f3ea63b-6b40-4f00-b945-e06a19af1306", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ffe2e0ddf37484ec4a9c294e16227ef1b4e76cd64c91b310d1eb1bb09edaffb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "7d8381a6-4915-4645-872b-635b333bfcf3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7213ca37ba5f0c97069df97f7173c51917c42b7cf4f3b52d989b00dbcfb4b6a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "d1080d4d-6fea-44d3-9e9b-d26a4e429419", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfbe32d3d11ca6623670d78ba6789119a591fbe69e132725c59992404548a381", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "A strong foundation of data is, of course, the precondition to sound actuarial analysis and for setting the right pricing and reserving structures for the health insurance business. \n\nACTUARIAL FUNCTION IN A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY  CHAPTER 6 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  135Test Yourself 4\nThe actuarial department of a health insurance company helps the insurance \ncompany to ___________________. \nI.

In order to maintain the trust of \npeople, it is imperative that the insurer honours the promise. A variety of risks such as insurance risk, invesrment risk or liquidity risk endanger the fullfillment of this promise. Self-regulation can protect the insurer against these risks. However an independent regulatory body is needed to add an extra degree of control on the insurance business. Also the regulatory authority needs to have the adequate amount of legal backing in order to do its job to the best of ability. \nThe chapter discusses the need for health insurance regulation, the principles of \nhealth regulation and various measures taken to enforce regulation. We also look at health insurance regulation in the Indian context and the role played by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA). \nLearning Outcomes \nA.

That leads us to the next question.  \nHow do we prevent the above situations from happening? \nThe answer lies in regulation.

The notion of leaving regulation to the \u201cgood sense\u201d of the companies does not always work.

Institutional failures and regulations \nInstitutional failures are, in general, caused by lax management, weak \ncorporate governance, poor central controls and supervision, unsound \naccounting systems and other infrastructure compounded by weaknesses in the \nlegal framework (IAIS, 1997). A study of 21 companies in financial trouble found that management issues were at the root of the problem (Lorent, 2008 citing Ashby, McDonnell and Sharma, 2002). Moreover, the complexity of health insurance business, the multiple risks which health insurers manage, and the market failures in the sector, all require a very effective top management role. \nWhen the regulator mandates a particular level of corporate governance, the \nlevel of regulatory involvement can decrease. Mechanisms like independent \ndirectors, actuaries, internal auditors etc. are often required (but that alone too did not work in the case of AIG). Thus, the complexity of health insurance business makes it very vulnerable to the effects of poor corporate governance. Regulation monitors and brings about timely corrective changes to reduce the risk of institutional failure. \nRegulation also serves to harmonise the activities of different players in order \nto achieve the desired social objectives from health insurance most notable of \nwhich is equitable access to health. .", "start_char_idx": 6595, "end_char_idx": 8947, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "157b8caf-07ff-4746-aad6-029dc02caba3": {"__data__": {"id_": "157b8caf-07ff-4746-aad6-029dc02caba3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "211ff817-fb02-4cfd-b3b0-a56e99f8d737", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf4f88f0f0ccab8218a706c600bb30447cd7933cbcb889e4ef527078ff95316d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "15a4163d-254b-4225-82ce-0186e7313baa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0ef2d8181e8371cdd85da7f9436c64074dd4720d9c5aac634d32d99b36df27c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "211ff817-fb02-4cfd-b3b0-a56e99f8d737", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf4f88f0f0ccab8218a706c600bb30447cd7933cbcb889e4ef527078ff95316d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "b74b2802-aec4-4796-8860-caca685e3312", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f58f7d1e1a0a0fc400d88b100673c093ac04c35044849ece5e921c1f255db882", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": ".

The statutory authority, Insurance \nRegulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) was established in 2000. \nThe Indian insurance industry is, thus, governed by Insurance Act, 1938, General \nInsurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972, Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, and IRDA Act 1999. \n3. Role of IRDA\nIRDA is not just a regulatory authority but also plays an active \u2018development\u2019 \nrole in health insurance, which has been established in the preamble of IRDA Act, section 14 of IRDA Act and Section 3(2AA) of Insurance Act 1938.  \nAs health insurance in India continues to be in its early stages, the role of IRDA \nis also very crucial in preventing adverse consequences of

transparency and fair business practices in the Indian Insurance industry through certain guidelines for both insurers and insured which aims to establish a healthy business environment.  \nAs part of its role as the apex body that governs the manner in which \nbusiness is conducted in the insurance industry, IRDA has formed Policyholder Protection Regulations, 2002 with a view to safeguarding the

The act mandates insurers to provide sufficient information to prospects regarding the aforementioned areas.  \nThe IRDA has a Grievance Redressal Cell which plays a facilitative role by \ntaking up complaints against insurers with the respective companies for speedy resolution. The IRDA however does not adjudicate on complaints. As claims/policy contracts in dispute require adjudication and the IRDA does not carry out any adjudication, insured are advised to approach the available quasi-judicial or judicial channels, i.e., the Insurance Ombudsmen, Consumer fora or the Civil courts for such complaints.  \nb) Access to health insurance for senior citizens and rural/informal \nsector workers \nIRDA act empowers it to issue regulations to the insurance company to cater \nto the needs of weaker and vulnerable section of population in specified manner.\nIRDA has laid down certain instructions for providing access to senior \ncitizens in 2009.

Frauds\nFrauds are present in any sector whether it is financial or non-financial industry.  \nPeople often hear about various types and forms of frauds in different industries/walks of life.  \nWhen it comes to insurance, the fraudsters think very differently and identify \nvarious loop holes in order to get a fraudulent claim.  \nA very famous and humorous incident that happened long ago will help the \nstudents to understand the gravity of insurance fraud and how a fraudster cannot go scot free for long.  \nExample\nOnce a person purchased a box of rare and expensive cigars and got fire \ninsurance cover for his cigars.  \nThe insurance company also understood the importance of the rarity of the \nbranded cigar and insured it with utmost good faith.  \nThe customer smoked the entire cigars within a month and claimed to the \ninsurer that the cigars were lost in a series of small fires (which indirectly \nmeans that he smoked).  \nThe insurance company refused to pay stating that cigar consumption will not \nqualify for the claim.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2216, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da2514f5-2101-4ec2-8979-93ad4996bae4": {"__data__": {"id_": "da2514f5-2101-4ec2-8979-93ad4996bae4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bfb1e35d-a847-4855-af7b-70e601581fc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b254bbd557c5970326d998ad2c2316f99b87ed4c69ea2d6e8dd91d54c3a7f933", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "23533dc5-b33a-4408-a0c6-fec1df558ec2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "84a0feb4d6172888310fcfb4cf4d7d607e0da4c2a700c844227bcdc24dc7ba47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "77ea9ebf-ff82-427c-9a59-618f7b7cd163", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac990080ca20d16b0c02d6152307610296c1137c77d0bed70800a32cb6e6044f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "bfb1e35d-a847-4855-af7b-70e601581fc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b254bbd557c5970326d998ad2c2316f99b87ed4c69ea2d6e8dd91d54c3a7f933", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "8390d9ae-fd30-415a-8d5c-e509fd51d7c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0d3ddb43f9fb42ae5d9507a3b78d21d0dfeff3291031262e8e3e5b7100e4f5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "2c943f2b-3a0e-486a-9356-e8fd7dfec13a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a60c32419216519b7af564e9bc0e43f0ae6180af316a626607d0577fa06cf8e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "8763f713-23ff-4ae2-b08c-8abe5b671392", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0cf62414f02621c3e3a24798c261db1e7459afae2c8fe531f75102088b584b8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "5bc8a469-c26f-47ec-977b-bed191993b8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "32989a15d57ebacb5b8aa82fd133c9876e2eba2019bf0e08d21493690678b642", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "bee5c9a0-6d46-48eb-82d3-52e68729197e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b60286ad2077c423f9a4c43d4f28b4176cf68f61b93da32e9ccb8c0f7431237e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "The insurance company refused to pay stating that cigar consumption will not \nqualify for the claim.  \nA case was filed before the court and court ruled in favour of the customer \nstating that the insurance company did not define in its policy as \u201cwhat is \nconsidered to be unacceptable fire and acceptable fire\u201d and hence, ordered the \ncompany to honour the claim (this shows the importance of policy wordings and conditions).  \nThe insurance company honoured the claim as directed by the court.  However, after the customer cashed the cheque, the insurance company had \nhim arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance claim and testimony \nfrom the previous case being used against him, the customer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in \njail and a $24,000 fine. \nDefinition \nHealth insurance fraud is described as an intentional act of deceiving, \nconcealing, or misrepresenting information that results in healthcare benefits \nbeing paid illegitimately to an individual or group.  \n\nPERCEPTION CUM CAUSES AND E FFECTS OF FRAUDS  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  175The main purpose of fraud is financial gain. However, it not only creates a hole \nin the insurance companies' pocket, but affects all the stakeholders.  \nIt not only invites higher premiums, but also leads to restricted benefits, higher \ninsurance co-payments; potential of denial for future coverage, higher service \ntaxes and also impacts the quality of care. \nTip\nVarious estimates indicate that fraudulent claims in the industry could be \nanywhere up to 15 - 20 per cent of total claims.  \nHealth insurance has even otherwise been a bleeding sector with very high \nclaims ratio.

Health insurance frauds vs. General insurance frauds  \nMotor and health insurance are very prone to insurance related frauds. \nDocuments such as fake medical bills and certificates are commonly used to defraud insurance companies in the country. These are followed by driving license and FIR related papers.  \nThere is a perception among customers that the insurance company pays less \nthan what you claim even if it is true loss assessment, which often motivates them to exaggerate their claims. \nIn Health Insurance frauds, it often requires cooperation from multiple \nstakeholders to organise a fraud. Though it may sound little difficult to get buy-in from other stakeholders like Hospitals, but once it is obtained, it becomes very easy job to lodge fraudulent claims.  \nThese days various multi-dimensional analyses are enabled by the insurance \ncompanies so that any fraudulent pattern is identified within the least possible \ntime. This enables to control the claims leakage in the shortest possible time.   \nBased on the pattern analysis, many triggers are set to ensure that fraudulent claims are not paid. Some of the triggers are given below. \n1.Triggers to detect fraud claims (only indicative but not exhaustive) \nInsurance frauds usually have common profile and pattern. There are certain \nparameters which can be used as a trigger to detect or analyse fraudulent \nclaims or practices. They are as follows: \na) Treatment costs are usually on the higher side as compared to the \netiology.\nb) Costlier investigations carried out without justification.  \nc) Diagnosis of the ailment and the investigations done are not much \nrelated to each other.  \nd) Duration of stay in the hospital is more than expected.  \ne) Post-operative histopathology reports are not available (surgical cases).  \nf) Documentations are usually in perfect order.  \ng) Higher number of re-imbursement claims from certain providers.", "start_char_idx": 6615, "end_char_idx": 9046, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11a191c5-4f95-45ba-8c8e-4b65ede2f6a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "11a191c5-4f95-45ba-8c8e-4b65ede2f6a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bfb1e35d-a847-4855-af7b-70e601581fc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b254bbd557c5970326d998ad2c2316f99b87ed4c69ea2d6e8dd91d54c3a7f933", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b770ea34-1d72-41a3-b79c-a361c3e0c7f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1dc1d4bdf8e717598b7e37fceb689e3bc51667fd9a44db102b2ded7e0238922a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "bfb1e35d-a847-4855-af7b-70e601581fc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b254bbd557c5970326d998ad2c2316f99b87ed4c69ea2d6e8dd91d54c3a7f933", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "ead890a0-3589-4cce-9eca-2571ef0f3772", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e733de4a59ebd79bb80e0a8f1da9406023693129c308a3f0d872e10d92ed20a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "g) Higher number of re-imbursement claims from certain providers. \nh) A pattern where the treating doctor, agents, ailments are the same in \nmany claims. \ni) Medicine bills in serial order. \nj) Patient residence and the hospital, chemist address, are not in same \ngeographical location  \nk) Short term policy holders with lower sum insured. \nl) Higher per-patient cost in a hospital.  \nm) Excessive patients\u2019 per-doctor in a hospital.", "start_char_idx": 8981, "end_char_idx": 9415, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5e6ddcf-a117-436a-83c0-a3e6dbc92b75": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5e6ddcf-a117-436a-83c0-a3e6dbc92b75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90097b64-5b3b-4a63-8302-c40398ca459c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffb90eacc289d7a1ff5ac76fe1810ac7292da3768dcaa3967f4e164415d4c092", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd4c8369-0a93-453f-825d-2bade09965a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "86dcb814bce62c29aa08649913560bf4d3a5ec6c94f69cb9a11e72109c4ac678", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "90097b64-5b3b-4a63-8302-c40398ca459c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffb90eacc289d7a1ff5ac76fe1810ac7292da3768dcaa3967f4e164415d4c092", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "8eab02dc-b3ae-453a-818c-b9a6ba326293", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2dc8c4335da32334aa63e4c7ea270bdf3300a88cb44ea12446635a5f78d60e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "26ffc400-fcfd-493f-9217-51b13158f207", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a620916e4324e2a72d107486fcd4e8774a61d72b9ae8fbc104e2cdb25fced323", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "4581b6d8-2760-414f-91fa-8fa1281dcec1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ac503c7baa19a85e8aa9e8ec8b111a99c7356fe0a50c0cf067b7de9444d907f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "5b4e3edf-9834-4ac6-9264-04e314504936", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63f34438f5d382f415080b9467ec804d12a98f63455787c654c3a9689e70c90b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "7be6c40c-e4ec-4d3d-8697-3bd5fd3b4b81", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d419aeb21ea21ddb5500ca6d2bc2ab47bff8445156615c2b4c099cfe15f03eeb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "35d19ccb-7a5c-44b9-aaec-d2d484207e24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2febcca722bab152de550ec9ef31364f7f6d8647104a81cdd21c3bce0dcecb29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "text": "m) Excessive patients\u2019 per-doctor in a hospital.  \nn) Higher per-patient average visit numbers. \no) Higher per-patient average medical tests.  \n\nCONSUMER FRAUDS  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  179Test Yourself 3\nWhich of the following parameters can be used by insurance companies as a \ntrigger to detect fraudulent claims? \nI.

Here \nthe fraud or misrepresentation can be in one or many of the following \nactivities;\ni. Disclosure of material information in the proposal form\nInsurance contract is a contract of utmost good faith where it is obligation \non both parties to provide all information which is material to the contract. It is therefore imperative that disclosure(s) of all material facts is made to \nthe Insurer.  \nHow a question is worded determines a lot as to how information will be \ngiven. If you do not ask a specific question, you cannot expect a specific answer.  \nii. Disclosure of material information at the medical stage:\nNormally Insurer seeks additional information about the insured\u2019s health by \nmedical examination (with regular or specializ ed tests) which is done basis \nthe sum assured or age or if there is any adversity noted in the application form.\nThe medical information collected through the empanelled diagnostic \ncentres helps the insurer in identifying any adversity/abnormality or accurately estimates the prognosis of the ailment thereby helping in pricing \nthe risk appropriately.  \nThe following disclosures have to be appropriately studied so as to weed out \nfraud:\n/g57Disclosure of health status to the medical examiner \nIf the individual is suffering from hypertension or diabetes unless the \napplicant discloses there is no way the medical examiner would know \nabout the same with mere simple medical examination.  \nEven further, if the person is on treatment with certain drugs, the lab \nfindings could still be in normal range and policy could be issued at normal rates as there is no disclosure about these ailments. These frauds potentially penalize the genuine policyholders.    \n\nCONSUMER FRAUDS  CHAPTER 9 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  183/g57Impersonation\nTo avoid this issue, insurers insist the applicants to carry a valid and \nauthentic photo ID proof which is checked by the empanelled centre \nbefore examination is done.

Address and contact details change\nHere care should be taken if the contact details including the address of the \ncustomer is changed just few days or weeks before the final financial transaction (like fund withdrawal, claim intimation ) is done or requested . The company may build additional checks before executing the transaction. \nii. Sum assured alterations i.e. increase or decrease of cover\nAny alteration to the risk cover should be dealt carefully and ascertained \nthat the same is initiated by the customer with appropriate disclosures.  \n\nCHAPTER 9  CONSUMER FRAUDS \n184 IC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE iii. Health checks undergone\nNormally this benefit is payable via refund of cost towards the health check \nundergone by the insured. Here the bills and documents submitted should be \nvalidated so as to ensure the customer has truly undergone the examination. \nThese transactions could vary based on the nature of product and \npermissible features of the product.

Introduction to reinsurance \nReinsurance is a risk transfer mechanism. It provides a method for insurance \ncompanies to diversify their risks by contributing a part of the premium \nreceived from customers to a reinsurance company, and receiving the \ncorresponding claims incurred from the reinsurance company.  \nDefinition \nReinsurance is the acceptance by one or more insurers, called reinsurers or assuming companies, of a portion of the risk underwritten by another insurer \nthat has contracted with an employer for the entire coverage. \nThe diagram below shows the basic flow of premiums and claims \u2013 between the \ncustomer, the insurance company and the reinsurance company.  \nDiagram 1: Basic flow of premiums and claims \nInsurance companies receive premiums from customers. This includes premiums \nreceived from corporate customers for products such as property insurance, marine hull insurance, marine cargo insurance, group health and similar covers. \nThey also receive premiums from individual customers for health insurance, \nmotor insurance, householders insurance etc.  \nOn the happening of a covered event, insurance companies pay out claims to \ncustomer.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO REINSURANCE  CHAPTER 10 \nIC-27 HEALTH INSURANCE  201Definition  \nAs the name suggests \u2013 \u201cRe-insurance\u201d is, at its simplest level, - \u201cinsurance for \ninsurers\u201d.   \n1. Quota share reinsurance \nDefinition  \nWhen the reinsurance contract is proportional to the original insurance contract, it is called quota share reinsurance.  \nIn such cases, typically a certain percentage of the original premium received \nfrom the customer is paid to the reinsurance company and the corresponding percentages of claims are received from the reinsurance company.  \nExample\nIn the case of a 30% quota share, the insurer transfers 30% of its liability and premiums on every risk to the reinsurer, who must pay 30% of any loss sustained, whether total or partial. \nThe percentage is constant throughout and applies to premiums and losses \nalike. \n2.

Indemnity health insurance  \nThe insurance cover pays for the actual cost of the health episode. In India, this \nproduct line is generically given the name of \u201cMedi-claim\u201d \u2013 usually these covers have an average sum insured of Rs.100,000 and they cover the cost of hospitalisation episodes only.  \n2. Critical Illness insurance It covers not only the cost of the ailment or disease but also the loss of earnings \nassociated with the same.

It is the insurance for insurers. \nb) When the reinsurance contract is proportional to the original insurance \ncontract, it is called quota share reinsurance. \nc) Surplus share reinsurance is a form of pro rata reinsurance indemnifying the \nceding company against loss to the extent of the surplus insurance liability ceded, on a share basis similar to quota share. \nd) Excess of loss reinsurance is a form of reinsurance that indemnifies the \nceding company for the portion of a loss that exceeds its own retention. \ne) Utility of reinsurance structures: \ni. Typically claims which are low severity and low frequency are not \nreinsured \nii. Claims which are medium to high severity and low frequency may be \nreinsured \niii. Claims which are high frequency and high severity would usually be \nreinsured \niv. Claims which are high frequency but low severity - typically such \nbusiness is reinsured only at a portfolio level \nf) Product lines of health insurance: \ni. Indemnity health insurance \nii.
